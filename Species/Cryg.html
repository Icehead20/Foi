            <p>Crygs are Civil Natura Malormes Cr, primarily inhabiting the kingdom of The Bubble, with a smaller population residing in the southern regions of the Prime Continent.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They're small, round creatures with six flexible, thin black limbs ending in small yellow feet. They come in two variants: one with a blue body featuring square patterns and the other with a purple body featuring wiggly patterns.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Descendants of a branch of the Crags species that diverged for ideological reasons, Crygs settled in the region of The Bubble in search of peaceful lives and prosperity. Today, most Crygs work in agriculture or in the waste treatment facilities for which The Bubble is known. The main Crag branch erased their past relationship with the Crygs from history, leading the Crygs to believe they are an original, independent species.</p>
			<p>Over time, Crygs physically adapted to their new environment. Their bodies, once suited for cold temperatures, lost fur and fat to better handle the warmer climate of The Bubble region.</p>
			<p>Crygs use their two front limbs like hands and their four rear limbs as legs, though the rear limbs are less flexible. When walking, they typically use all six limbs. The yellow ends of their limbs have antibacterial properties, reducing the risk of contamination.</p>
			<p>Crygs can spit a ball of saliva for self-defense, though they rarely use this intentionally, often doing it out of fear instead. Their saliva, like the ends of their limbs, has antibacterial properties. Wild creatures in The Bubble region sometimes attack Crygs to consume their saliva and feet when they are sick.</p>
			<p>Crygs come in two color variants—blue with square patterns and purple with wiggly patterns—it is believed that this coloration is to help them camouflage alongside The Bubble from The Bubble region, which shares these colors.</p>
			<p>Although they resemble Mexitons physically, Crygs are not related to them. Due to their similar physical attributes, many Crygs have chosen to live alongside Mexitons in Mexico, as environments suitable for Mexitons also suit Crygs.</p>
			<p>Because of their relatively small population and remote habitat, Crygs have little influence in popular culture and lack representation in international politics.</p>
