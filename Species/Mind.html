            <p>Minds are Natura Malormes Ballus that predominantly inhabit the Ebri Kingdom. They are recognized for their simple, spherical appearance and, most famously, for possessing psychic abilities unique among all known terrestrial species.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Minds are round creatures with light yellow skin entirely covered in short, light blue fur. They have black eyes, a small mouth, and a black antenna tipped with a red, crystal-like orb.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Minds are the only known creatures capable of psychic manipulation. To use this ability, a Mind must first focus on fully comprehending the shape of the desired object. Simple objects are relatively easy to manipulate, while more complex or moving forms require greater concentration and cause considerable strain. Once understood, the object can be levitated and moved freely through psychic force, channeled via the antenna’s orb known as the Ank.</p>
			<p>The Ank serves as the organ that gathers and focuses a Mind’s thoughts into psychic output. When activated, it radiates a purple glow, and objects under psychic influence are surrounded by a matching aura. Minds can also memorize the structure of objects, allowing easier repeated manipulation.</p>
			<p>If the antenna or Ank is damaged, a Mind’s psychic ability weakens or may be lost entirely. Since Minds depend on levitation for most movement, this leaves them largely bedridden and considered severely disabled. The Ank is biological in nature, composed of cellular crystalline tissue. Damage to this structure can heal over time, the Ank orb is considered the tip that reaches down with long filaments within the antenna that connect directly to the Mind’s brain, fusing with it at the top.</p>
			<p>Minds’ abilities have limits. Complex or shifting shapes are difficult to comprehend, making moving targets a challenge. For this reason, those threatened by a hostile Mind are advised to keep moving to evade restraint. In theory, a Mind could use its power lethally by comprehending the internal anatomy of living beings and crushing their organs; however, this requires extensive study, memory, and effort, and thus remains impractical for most individuals.</p>
			<p>The body of a Mind is largely composed of fat surrounding a skull-like core that houses the vital organs. This fatty layer cushions their body and protects them when they cease levitation and settle onto surfaces. Their eyes are highly sensitive to light and specialized for detecting silhouettes, assisting them in quickly grasping the outlines of objects for psychic use.</p>
			<p>Minds possess both internal reproductive organs and are capable of both asexual and sexual reproduction. They can psychically manipulate their own genetic material for self-fertilization, or transfer it to others. External fertilization is more beneficial, as it allows greater genetic diversity.</p>
			<p>It is believed that Minds once had more complex, limb-based bodies, but over time they evolved into simple spherical forms as reliance on psychic powers made physical limbs unnecessary. This spherical body shape is easier for them to manipulate and levitate.</p>
			<p>The origin of the Ank and their psychic abilities remains unknown. No other terrestrial species has developed comparable abilities or biological structures. Only certain extraterrestrial beings exhibit similar traits, leading some to speculate that Minds may have extraterrestrial ancestry, though no evidence supports this theory.</p>
			<p>Minds are generally docile and avoid conflict, though many exhibit prideful or self-important personalities. This is attributed to their hierarchical social structure, with some individuals attempting to emulate traits of nobility or higher rank.</p>
			<p>Historically, Minds were among the first species to join the First Kings during their pilgrimage across the Prime Continent. Originally from the Rosaldew region, they gained favor with the ruling Queen of the time and accompanied the Kings until their settlement in the Ebri Kingdom. Today, Minds are the primary population of the Kingdom, alongside the native Bodys and Souls.</p>
			<p>Most Minds reside within the Ebri Kingdom and its neighboring regions, rarely found elsewhere. They commonly work in construction and heavy labor outside their homeland, where their psychic powers are especially valuable, while in Ebri they occupy intellectual and administrative roles.</p>
			<p>Rumors persist of a reclusive Mind cult dwelling in the Eslawba region. These Minds are described as hairless, wearing strange hats, and practicing esoteric rites. They are said to possess forbidden knowledge of comprehension and psychic manipulation, though their existence remains unverified.</p>
