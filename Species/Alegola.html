            <p>The Alegolas are Natura CosiPlants S/A that reside on the seabed of Mareala and the southern regions of Detlol. They share a close relationship with the Payegolas.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>These small green creatures feature tentacles atop their bodies, shaped like socks with the opening at the top. They have a small mouth located at their base, and on their front, they possess two black eyes.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Their movement involves leaping across the seabed, employing their tentacles to scale any elevated structures encountered.</p>
			<p>Alegolas have limited eyesight during the day, functioning better in nocturnal and dark conditions.</p>
			<p>They fed on smaller sea creatures. They would capture them with their tentacles and consume them, storing leftovers in the opening at the top of their heads as reserves.</p>
			<p>While capable of photosynthesis, the sustenance gained is insufficient for their prolonged survival.</p>
			<p>These creatures do not sleep but can rest some senses while remaining alert at all times.</p>
			<p>Their remarkable resistance to temperature fluctuations stems from their malleable bodies. Although research has explored this trait, attempts to utilize or replicate this property for widespread consumption have yet to be successful.</p>
			<p>Alegolas maintain a close, relationship with the Payegolas.</p>
			<p>During a crisis caused by the oil split in Detlol their old habitad, Alegolas faced hunger for the dead of their prey and started to deplet in numbers. Survivors migrated eastward, encountering the Payegolas. Both species formed a symbiotic relationship: Alegolas safeguarded the Payegolas, who reciprocated by providing sustenance and protection against predators. At night, Alegolas protected the resting Payegolas.</p>
			<p>Subsequently, both species migrated north once stability was achieved.</p>
			<p>Currently, Alegolas hunt Genefis among other species near Still River.</p>
			<p>Their unique relationship and history were discovered by a team initially intending to document the effects of the oil split in Detlol. However, upon the unexpected discovery of the Payegolas and Alegolas, the documentary's focus shifted, capturing their story over years, now renowned worldwide.</p>
