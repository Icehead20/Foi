            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Capego are Divine Leftovers that originate rarely in pitch-dark areas of the universe.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are simple in shape, being an orange pill-shaped, mid-sized creature with a small mouth in their front side and flames coming out of their top.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Capegos generate with a 0.0000001% probability per minute in pitch-dark areas. They generally generate in caves underground, at midnight in solitary areas, in the void of space, or in the depths of the ocean.</p>
			<p>If a Capego’s flame is put out, it will immediately perish. This means Capegos that generate underwater or in space perish immediately after coming into existence. It is theorized that the multiple asteroids in space are actually cloisters of Capego corpses floating in space.</p>
			<p>Capego’s sentience is debated. They seem to be completely emotionless and unaware of their surroundings. They don’t seem to have needs of any kind and just float mindlessly around without any direction, maintaining the same expression no matter what happens to them.</p>
			<p>Capego meat holds barely any nutritional value or taste and is bland. Their whole body is composed entirely of muscle, and the interior of their mouth doesn’t lead to anything, making it more like just a hole. Their meat can be consumed but is recommended only as a last resort.</p>
			<p>While alive, Capegos are immune to their own fire and those of other Capegos, but they can be affected by external fire. When they die, they immediately lose these properties. It is recommended to hunt them with a long-range weapon and consume them roasted to maximize their very little health factor in case of need.</p>
			<p>When a Capego perishes, their fire will also immediately extinguish. This fire is special; it only needs oxygen to exist and doesn’t usually spread over to other things, not even the driest of branches. This fire hurts to the touch but less than other conventional fires.</p>
			<p>In the past, they’ve been both consumed and praised as deities, especially in Terraido and sections of the Zet Continent. The meat of some Capegos was cooked in the flames of other Capegos for consumption in rituals.</p>
			<p>Even though they share similarities and the same origin, Capegos and Libegos are considered different species. They don’t interact in any meaningful way with each other, even though it was once believed that Libegos were the leader or superior version of Capegos.</p>
			<p>Currently, it’s common for the police or guards of every region to take care of Capego sightings. Since they offer no resistance, the usual method is to penetrate them with a lance or long-reach weapon to dispose of their body or use them with other ingredients to make cattle food. Seeing a Capego under normal circumstances is seen as a bad luck omen, but seeing one in extremely desperate situations is thought of as an omen of hope, indicating that the end isn’t near.</p>
			<p>Capegos originated as a by-product of the sword of the goddess Forge. It is said that the clashes of its sword generated flaming sparks that became Capegos and Libegos. Some believe they were the creation of the goddess Lava because of their relation to fire. Both theories are considered equally plausible as both goddesses are related to flames. Some theorize it is both at the same time, as it is thought Lava made Forge’s sword.</p>
