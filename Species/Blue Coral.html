            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>These beings are a collective of thousands of unicellular organisms, amalgamated into a single entity with a shared consciousness. Constructing a solid base, they produce white sensory cells that perceive the environment on their eye-shaped holes. When other creatures approach, they emit attractant hormones, inviting them to reside comfortably within their interiors. The Blue Coral absorbs organic matter left by these inhabitants, aiding in its nourishment.</p>
			<p>Their rough exterior and branching structure not only provide shelter but also aid in gathering organic matter. Passing marine life can inadvertently leave behind nourishment as they navigate, benefitting the Blue Coral.</p>
			<p>Blue Corals foster diverse marine habitats, although they may inadvertently cause minor irritation to passing creatures due to their abrasive surfaces. Nevertheless, this inconvenience often outweighs the risk of predators, making the Coral a sought-after sanctuary.</p>
			<p>Sensitive to oil, Blue Corals can suffer severe damage akin to acidic burns when exposed.</p>
			<p>Blue Corals are highly sensitive to chemical pollutants and waste in the ocean. increased ocean pollution has significantly diminished their population in recent years.</p>
			<p>Red Corals their 'rivals', grow rapidly, often overtaking and ultimately killing Blue Corals to consume them.</p>
			<p>Their captivity has gained popularity, particularly as tank decorations, following the development of specialized food formulas that sustain them. However, this upkeep comes at a considerable monetary cost.</p>
