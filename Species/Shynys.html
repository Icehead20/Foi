            <p>Shynys are Natura Oceans Molusle that can inhabit both fresh and salt waters all around the globe.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Shynys are small, green, slimy creatures with a body that’s covered in small bumps, with two larger, bubble-like bumps on the front that function as eyes. On top of their bodies, they carry shells that come in a variety of colors.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>They move slowly, filtering and absorbing organic matter that touches their skin. They comb the ground beneath them, consuming what they can, including small foliage.</p>
			<p>The two large bumps on their front are sensory organs that help them 'see' their surroundings and sense water currents. If they detect danger, they hide under their shells.</p>
			<p>Shynys compress all their waste and unusable matter into a ball inside their bodies. When they can no longer store it, they release this waste in a bubble that, if not popped, can float to the water's surface.</p>
			<p>Shynys reproduce asexually, laying numerous eggs during their lifespan. They deposit their eggs in corners and holes in rocks or the ground to hide them. Once laid, the Shynys abandon the eggs, which absorb minerals from their surroundings and hatch in about a week, though not all at once.</p>
			<p>Their shells form while they are still in the egg and grow with them over time. The color of the shell depends on the minerals in the surrounding water, with heavier minerals resulting in warmer colors and lighter minerals producing cooler colors.</p>
			<p>Their adaptable physiology allows them to thrive in both freshwater and saltwater environments, making them widespread and a staple in various cuisines worldwide. However, with the discovery of the Tastly, a related species prized for its superior flavor, Shynys have become known as the 'poor man’s Tastly' and have fallen out of favor.</p>
			<p>Historically, Shynys have been used for their filtering capabilities to purify water for consumption. Organizations continue to use them to provide clean water in low-resource areas at affordable prices.</p>
			<p>Shynys are bred in large-scale farms, where they are kept in tanks that automatically remove their waste bubbles when they reach the surface.Thought a common challenge in these farms is removing excess eggs that exceed the tank's population limit.</p>
			<p>Additionally, Shynys are kept as pets in the central region of the Prime Continent, particularly in areas far from water bodies where they are considered a novelty.</p>
