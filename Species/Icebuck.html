            <p>Icebuck are Civil Divine Wormterrain that primarily live in the Ice Kingdom and are considered one of the most forgotten Civil species in the world.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Due to the material they are made of, Icebucks can technically adopt different forms depending on the amount of ice they have and how it is sculpted. However, there are generally two main types: the half-octagon type, which is medium height but lacks width, and the more rounded type with spikes. Both types are made of ice and have black eyes.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>When a group of Wormterrain goo assimilates a block of ice, it becomes alive as a newborn Icebuck. These newborns have the capacities of a grown adult, which is the oldest birth age of all Wormterrain species. The Wormterrain that produced the goo is considered the parent of the newborn Icebuck.</p>
			<p>Icebucks are generally very fragile and susceptible to body damage, but they can be easily reconstructed with the addition of more ice, which will be assimilated after a couple of days. As long as the core (their eyes) and a portion of the ice around it remain intact, the Icebuck will stay alive. They don't feel pain if they get cracked, so they often don't notice damage, which can lead to more severe issues.</p>
			<p>If an Icebuck melts completely, its core will scatter, resulting in its death. Therefore, they can only live in cold areas such as Borealis, Snow Mountain, and the Ice Kingdom. The Ice Kingdom is home to most of the population, created over generations by Icebucks born nearby who had short lifespans. With much hard work, they eventually built the kingdom as a cold ice underground cavern where they can live without fear of melting.</p>
			<p>Icebucks produce goo internally very quickly after birth, vomiting it once a certain amount is produced. However, the assimilation of ice takes significantly longer, sometimes years, making Icebucks the slowest to fully develop among Wormterrains. Once fully assimilated, an Icebuck can assimilate more ice to their body much faster. If an Icebuck melts while still containing goo, the goo can survive and assimilate the ground below where the Icebuck melted.</p>
			<p>An Icebuck's body can only handle a limited amount of ice. Beyond a certain point, the ice won't be assimilated and will act as dead weight, hindering movement.</p>
			<p>The spiky variant of Icebucks is sculpted this way to serve as soldiers, but since the Ice Kingdom has never faced significant trouble due to its insignificance, these Icebucks often serve as local police or royal guards. Recently, some Icebucks have chosen this spiky look for fashion.</p>
			<p>Icebuck culture is mostly contained to their inhabited areas. In the Ice Kingdom, manual arts and ice mechanisms are prominent. In Borealis, they share the farm-centric culture of the native Sailas. Similarly, in Snow Mountain, they share an interest in theaters and acting.</p>
			<p>Because the Ice Kingdom is often overlooked and forgotten by other nations and due to the specific living requirements of Icebucks, they are rare or nonexistent in most other areas. This makes them one of the most overlooked and forgotten Civil species on the planet.</p>
