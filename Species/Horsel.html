            <p>Horsel are Natura Oceans Malerceans found throughout the Mareala Ocean and Carala.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are medium-sized blue creatures with a small tear-shape body, a curled tail, a large head adorned with yellow messy hair, prominent eyes, and a pointed nose.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>To defend themselves, Horsels employ sudden headbutts with the force of a hammer. These attacks are involuntary movements triggered when Horsels feel stressed or threatened, making stressed-out Horsels known for their potential danger.</p>
			<p>Horsels typically inhabit shallow waters, sustaining themselves on algae and microorganisms. They prefer residing in small, confined spaces, finding comfort in such environments. Excluding their offspring, Horsels can tolerate the presence of other beings for short durations, but for extended periods cause them to stress out.</p>
			<p>If a Horsel isn't able to consume food on a semi-constant basis they'll also start to stress out.</p>
			<p>Maintaining Horsels in captivity is challenging due to their propensity for breaking aquarium glass when stressed out, leading to property damage.</p>
			<p>In strong water currents, Horsels use their tails to anchor onto seaweed and prevent being swept away.</p>
			<p>Horsels lack specific genders. During breeding, the smaller Horsel becomes pregnant, while the larger one departs. This arrangement is believed to be advantageous as the smaller Horsel can conceal itself more effectively in marine terrain, ensuring the safety of the offspring.</p>
			<p>Horsels can give birth to approximately 20 offspring, which are expelled like bullets from the parent's cloaca. Offspring follow their parents, who assist in chewing food and providing support until they reach maturity. Afterward, the offspring diverge and go their separate ways.</p>
			<p>In modern times, some people appreciate Horsels for their beauty but acknowledge the potential danger they pose. In ancient times, the discovery of marine creature corpses floating in the water, victims of Horsel strikes, led people to believe in marine monsters or spectres.</p>
