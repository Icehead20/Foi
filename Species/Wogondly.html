            <p>Wogondly are Natura Mutibugs Armer that live in the northern forests of Verdosola.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They exhibit a petite build, characterized by a slender form and a rounded head housing two compound eyes and an elongated yellow beak. Towards their rear, a segmented yellow section culminates in a pink-colored tail. Adorning their back are four leaf-like, green wings.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Wogondlys embark on flights to locate trees with edible leaves and suitable trunks to craft their nests. Using their beaks, they diligently carve out a hole in the bark, fashioning a snug dwelling within it.</p>
			<p>Typically, they venture out from their nests between 3:00 am and 1:00 pm, feeding on leaves until satiated, then vigilantly guarding their trees until fatigue beckons them back to their nests.</p>
			<p>Wogondlys are fiercely territorial among their kin, fiercely defending their tree against other Wogondlys.</p>
			<p>Their lifespan extends to approximately four months. During the breeding season, females seek out males with the pinkest tails for mating, leading to congregations of numerous Wogondlys in a specific area during this period.</p>
			<p>After reproducing, females seek solitary trees, create holes in their base, lay between 1 to 4 eggs, and abandon them thereafter, severing all ties beetween them.</p>
			<p>Encounters between Wogondlys outside the breeding season often result in skirmishes, though typically they engage in a mere 2 or 3 pecks before parting ways. They don't exhibit aggression toward other species apart from their own.</p>
			<p>Newly hatched Wogondlys spend days within their hollow practicing flight maneuvers and familiarizing themselves with their surroundings before taking flight and seeking a tree to call their own.</p>
			<p>Wogondlys possess fully developed beaks from birth. Although their beaks can regenerate if broken, their lifespan is generally too short for this regrowth to have a significant impact.</p>
			<p>Wogondlys use their beaks to extract nectar from the pink flowers that grow in the forests they inhabit.</p>
			<p>The shape of their wings primarily serves camouflage purposes. There were previous theories suggesting they might have plant-like qualities or were straight up plants, but these ideas have been debunked.</p>
			<p>As only one Wogondly can inhabit a tree at a time, the species has faced multiple crises due to limited nesting spaces.</p>
