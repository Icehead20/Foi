            <p>Bonedish are Divine Ghosts that originate from the souls of marine creatures and are usually found underwater.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are small creatures made of a material similar to bone, with an elongated oval shape divided into two sections. They have two eye holes and two fin-like structures on their back that they can move freely.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>When a soul of a marine non-Civil creature finds its remains in the Blue Plane will be reborn as a Bonedish, no matter the type of marine creature they were before. They may or may not retain memories of their past life depending on how successful they were in this process before being attacked and consumed by the Hellsnake.</p>
			<p>Like all ghosts, they are affected by and can be destroyed by the power of Soulnaker stones and the energy they produce.</p>
			<p>Bonedish are completely physical and can be harmed in conventional ways. If they break, they disappear completely. They have no necessities of any kind, resembling living skeletons.</p>
			<p>Even though they have eye sockets, Bonedish lack conventional vision. Instead, they can sense movement and the presence of creatures within a small radius around them. This is the only sense they possess.</p>
			<p>These creatures inhabit the depths of any body of water with biological life, such as ponds and large lakes, all over the world. Due to their small size, they pose no threat to other species. They lack nutritional value or flavor, so they are not eaten by other creatures. Their existence does not impact the environment positively or negatively.</p>
			<p>Bonedish do not move much, simply resting in their habitat without significantly interacting with the ecosystem. When something approaches them, they flutter, producing a sound similar to castanets. If taken out of water, they jump around trying to find water, and may accidentally bite and cause minor damage, that's the most interaction they can bring to anything.</p>
			<p>They tend to gather in groups, forming piles on the ground and staying close together. These piles are called "Bonebanquets", the reason of these behavior is unknown.</p>
			<p>Bonedish are considered a plague when they appear in fountains or water pipes, clogging them. However, they face no significant threats and are easily eliminated. Average people can get rid of them without needing the Ghost Buster institution or Soulnaker assistance.</p>
			<p>It is unknown how many Bonedish exist in the world, but it is theorized that millions of them plague the seabeds in the depths of the Mareala Sea.</p>
