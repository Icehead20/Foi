            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Tulipods are Civil Natura CosiPlant F/A beings native to the Zet Continent. Originally evolving in the Spain region and spreading to the rest of the Zet Continent. They are one of the two Lañol variants.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Tulipods are tall, bipedal plant-based beings, with thin legs and large arms ending in fingerless mitten-like hands with only a usable thumb. Their skin is light green, their eyes are typically red, and their hair is dark green. Their most iconic feature is the “flower skirt”, a petal-like dress formation that grows around their hips and extends nearly to the ground. This skirt opens in the front, revealing their legs, which are further distinguished by two yellow stems that emerge from the skirt’s base and spiral around each leg, ending in bulbous terminal buds that function as natural shoes. Crowning their heads is the characteristic pink crest with yellow stems, a signature trait of a lot of CosiPlant species.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Originally, the base Lañol species evolved from a giant rose-like flower, likely affected by irregular genetics, which led to their transformation into one of the first Civil CosiPlants species. This same lineage also gave rise to their variants: Tulipod and Roold. These variants can unpredictably appear among offspring, regardless of the parents’ form. It is thought that Tulipods appearance is more resembling what the giant rose-like flower they evolved from looked when it was just about to fully sprout their flower.</p>
			<p>Their hair is a unique biological paste that behaves similarly to clay, allowing Tulipod to sculpt it into various hairstyles. Their hair is slightly different to Lañol’s, it has considerably more volume and is more greasy.</p>
			<p>As Tulipod mature, “Spikimples” may grow from their skin, these are twirl-like appendages that sometimes sprout leaves. These are harmless but often considered aesthetically undesirable. Improper removal can lead to rough or scarred skin, so professional removal is expensive, so it is not uncommon to see Tulipod with these appendages on their skin.</p>
			<p>Tulipod reproduce by intertwining their stems, leading to the creation of a large seed. With proper care, this seed sprouts into a sprout that remains half-buried while its legs develop, a process that typically takes 4 to 6 years. Reproduction between Tulipods have more chances to give another Tulipod as an offspring.</p>
			<p>These young sprouts are placed in large pots during development. They move by hopping while potted. Pulling a young Tulipot of its pot prematurely can result in growth deformities or even permanent leg underdevelopment.</p>
			<p>Before potting was common, sprouts were raised in "kid plantations”—communal soil beds with constant supervision. While those methods often produced stronger legs, they came with higher risks of accidents, making the pot system the safer modern alternative which also provides mobility and independence to the sprouts.</p>
			<p>The iconic flower skirt starts growing during childhood and continues growing over time. Alongside the growth of the skirt, the stems grow and wrap around the Tulipod’s legs gripping them hard. Ending on the terminal bud enveloping the tips becoming a sort of shoes for the Tulipod. These stems can’t be taken out or unwrapped without hardly harming the legs of the Tulipod, since the skin of the Tulipod fuses with the stem as it grows.</p>
			<p>A fully grown Tulipod has stronger legs than Lañol’s and a stronger grip to the floor, but they can’t get to run as fast as Lañol’s.</p>
			<p>Though they are plant-based, Tulipod’s chlorophyll efficiency decreases with age. While sprouts can absorb sunlight for energy, fully grown Tulipods must eat like other species and cannot survive on sunlight alone.</p>
			<p>They also lack regenerative abilities, unlike some other CosiPlant species. If injured or dismembered, they cannot regrow lost limbs or major structures—only the stems on their head consistently regenerate when cut.</p>
			<p>Tulipod are well-regarded for their natural beauty, especially above Lañols. Skin care and grooming are core aspects of their culture, particularly the care of the exposed parts of their legs, and the beauty industry is one of the most lucrative among them.</p>
			<p>Although they originated in forest regions, Tulipod have adapted to a wide range of environments and professions. Their strong legs, long reach, and general stamina allow them to perform many physical tasks. However, their lack of fingers limits their ability in jobs requiring precise manipulation or toolwork.</p>
			<p>Not counting their two variants, Tulipods are among the tallest Civil species, surpassed only by Reink, Purple Guardians, and Bandenlla.</p>
			<p>Although not as widespread as Lañols, they can be found in small quantities everywhere there’s Lañols, usually they are considered more sedentary than Lañols in terms of exploring outside their comfort zone.</p>
			<p>A curious trend is that Tulipods are usually more egotist and thinking higher of themselves than their other variants. They are also known for being more dreamy and absent minded during quiet times. It is thought that this is because of hormonal imbalances because of their genetic irregularities.</p>
