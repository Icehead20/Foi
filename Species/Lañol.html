            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Lañol are Civil Natura CosiPlant F/A beings native to the Zet Continent, where they are one of the most numerous and widespread Civil species. Originally evolving in the Spain region, they have since expanded across the entire continent.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Lañol are tall, bipedal plant-based creatures, with thin legs and large arms ending in fingerless mitten-like hands, with only a usable thumb. Their skin is light green, their eyes are typically red, and they have dark green, paste-like hair resembling moldable clay. Their most distinct feature is a “leaf skirt”, a natural dress-like growth of foliage that starts around their hips and often extends all the way to the ground. Crowning their heads is the characteristic pink crest with yellow stems, a signature trait of a lot of CosiPlant species.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Lañol evolved from a giant rose-like flower, likely affected by irregular genetics, which led to their transformation into one of the first Civil CosiPlants species. This same lineage also gave rise to their two known variants: Tulipod and Roold. These variants can unpredictably appear among offspring, regardless of the parents’ form.</p>
			<p>Their hair is a unique biological paste that behaves similarly to clay, allowing Lañol to sculpt it into various hairstyles. The long hair style is especially popular.</p>
			<p>As Lañol mature, “Spikimples” may grow from their skin, these are twirl-like appendages that sometimes sprout leaves. These are harmless but often considered aesthetically undesirable. Improper removal can lead to rough or scarred skin, so professional removal is expensive, so it is not uncommon to see Lañol with these appendages on their skin.</p>
			<p>Lañol reproduce by intertwining their stems, leading to the creation of a large seed. With proper care, this seed sprouts into a Lañol sprout that remains half-buried while its legs develop, a process that typically takes 4 to 6 years.</p>
			<p>These young sprouts are placed in large pots during development. They move by hopping while potted. Pulling a young Lañol out of its pot prematurely can result in growth deformities or even permanent leg underdevelopment.</p>
			<p>Before potting was common, sprouts were raised in "kid plantations”—communal soil beds with constant supervision. While those methods often produced stronger legs, they came with higher risks of accidents, making the pot system the safer modern alternative which also provides mobility and independence to the sprouts.</p>
			<p>The iconic leaf skirt begins as a few layers during childhood and continues growing over time. In healthy individuals, it typically reaches the floor. If growth is stunted, part of the legs may remain visible. While this is rarely a sign of medical concern, it can carry aesthetic stigma.</p>
			<p>Though they are plant-based, Lañol's chlorophyll efficiency decreases with age. While sprouts can absorb sunlight for energy, fully grown Lañol must eat like other species and cannot survive on sunlight alone.</p>
			<p>They also lack regenerative abilities, unlike some other CosiPlant species. If injured or dismembered, they cannot regrow lost limbs or major structures—only the stems on their head consistently regenerate when cut.</p>
			<p>Lañol are well-regarded for their natural beauty. Skin care and grooming are core aspects of their culture, particularly the care of the torso area, and the beauty industry is one of the most lucrative among them.</p>
			<p>Although they originated in forest regions, Lañol have adapted to a wide range of environments and professions. Their strong legs, long reach, and general stamina allow them to perform many physical tasks. However, their lack of fingers limits their ability in jobs requiring precise manipulation or toolwork.</p>
			<p>They often coexist with or live near Frêirak, another species that emerged around the same time and in the same general area. Historically, the relationship was marked by conflict and mockery, though this has softened into jovial, ironic rivalry in modern times.</p>
			<p>Although now widespread, Lañol are rare in island nations and outside the Zet Continent. On the Prime Continent, they’re more often seen as tourists than residents.</p>
			<p>Not counting their two variants, Lañol are among the tallest Civil species, surpassed only by Reink, Purple Guardians, and Bandenlla.</p>
			<p>Their wide reach, cultural significance, and flexible adaptation make them one of the Zet Continent’s most recognized and influential Civil species.</p>
