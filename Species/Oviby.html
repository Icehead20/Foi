            <p>Oviby are Civil Artificial Crystalogy created and primarily residing in Plus Mountain, where they work as guards, workers, and in other important roles. They are considered the Magnum Opus of Crystalogy design.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Oviby are medium-sized creatures with a spaceship-like design. They feature a metallic donut shape with small yellow circular lights around its external side. Their purple crystals are partially visible in the middle, showing both upwards and downwards. On the upward-facing one, they have two black eyes.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Oviby are created using Plus Mountain's Purple Crystals as their main power source, incorporating mechanical robotic parts to harness and shape this energy into a form of life. Their Purple Crystals are stored both internally and externally, while their energy conversion mechanisms are housed in their metallic components.</p>
			<p>The Purple Crystals serve not only as an energy source but also as storage for their memories and personalities. Damage to these crystals can lead to mental issues and other complications.</p>
			<p>Oviby were created using alien technology from the moon known as War, specifically from their robotic spaceships called Warufo, which is why they resemble them. They can fly using the same mechanisms as the alien ships, and part of their energy is redirected to their Purple Crystals, making them hardened and more powerful. This energy is too much for a single Purple Crystal to handle, so they have two: one facing upwards with their eyes and one facing downwards. They are the only Crystalogy to possess two Purple Crystals in this manner.</p>
			<p>One of Oviby's main features is their ability to suddenly channel a wave of special energy to their downward-facing Purple Crystal, causing it to elongate downward like a spear. They use this ability as a primary weapon or to stab and carry objects.</p>
			<p>The special eyes of the Warufo, which allow them to see in the dark, could not be replicated in Oviby's design. Instead, a range of lights was installed around their mechanical parts, enabling them to illuminate dark areas.</p>
			<p>Due to their flying abilities, Oviby are considered to have some of the most freedom among Crystalogys. They are also one of the most mass-produced, alongside Cristalife. Most reside in Plus Mountain, but many also live in other areas, making them the Crystalogy with the largest population outside of Plus Mountain.</p>
			<p>On Plus Mountain, they are highly valued for their ability to guard and chase threats quickly and use their spear-like Crystal ability to deal with dangers. They also use this ability to destroy rocks and carry debris and other objects. Some Oviby work in administrative roles and generally help with various tasks. Due to their versatility, Oviby are considered the Magnum Opus of Crystalogy and are produced in large quantities. However, their reliance on the extreme energy waves of War technology means that breakdowns and repairs are not uncommon.</p>
			<p>Oviby often appear to have an angry expression and are very vocal and loud, which can scare some people. However, they are generally well-meaning and proactive, willing to help. This is why they are also valued outside of Plus Mountain.</p>
			<p>Oviby's similarities to War technology have caused some controversies although, as they have been mistaken for actual Warufos on multiple occasions, causing panic among people who fear another alien invasion.</p>
			<p>Uferalda, a larger Oviby model, was created to care for Oviby and serve as their leader. Uferalda can directly access the data of all regular Oviby within a certain radius and send private messages to them, which are processed by the Oviby like telepathic communication. It can even control an Oviby's actions. However, some Oviby view these abilities as a violation of privacy and oppose them.</p>
