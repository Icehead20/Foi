            <p>Spoon are Civil Artificial Crystalogy, created accidentally on Plus Mountain, where most of their population resides and works as guards.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Spoon are round, metallic creatures with a light gray color. They have a spring at the bottom and cannons on their sides and top, which are a darker gray color. On one side, they have two large eyes and a small mouth.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Spoon are created using Plus Mountain's Purple Crystals as their main power source, incorporating mechanical robotic parts to harness and shape this energy into a form of life. The Purple Crystal is stored internally at the core of their head along with their main energy conversion mechanisms.</p>
			<p>Besides serving as an energy source, the Purple Crystal also acts as storage for their memories and personalities. Damage to this component can lead to mental issues and other complications.</p>
			<p>Spoon were created as a literal joke during the experimental phase of Purple Crystal technology development. Engineers designed numerous blueprints for future Crystalogy models. One engineer created a joke blueprint of a theoretical model that utilized springs and was highly inefficient by design. This blueprint was mistakenly taken seriously, resulting in the creation of a batch of Spoon model Crystalogy robots.</p>
			<p>Their name comes from the cooking utensil, part of the joke of their creation, and their silhouette resemblance to a spoon when their cannons are removed.</p>
			<p>Upon discovering the mistake of their creation, the model was immediately discontinued, making the original batch the only existing Spoon. Today, Spoon are rare, even in Plus Mountain where most of them reside.</p>
			<p>Relying on their spring for mobility in the rocky terrain of Plus Mountain makes Spoon prone to short and long falls. While their metal exterior offers some protection, it doesn't fully safeguard the internal Purple Crystal from developing cracks, leading to various issues. These cracks often cause Spoon to behave in ways that others describe as "dumb," "crazy," or "silly". All existing Spoon have problems related to this issue.</p>
			<p>Spoon can shoot metal bullets from any of their three cannons. Although their ammunition is limited, they can manually replenish it or generate new ammunition by consuming material through their mouth, compressing it internally into bullets made from the consumed material.</p>
			<p>Spoon live almost exclusively on Plus Mountain, working as guards. Other species in the region, who generally dislike their strange behavior, largely disregard them. Their guard duties were assigned mainly to give them a purpose, but Spoon are the most dispensable guards and contribute the least.</p>
			<p>There is little demand for Spoon-based products or facilities because these usually work constantly on their guard duties disregarding any other activity or comfort. When they are given a task they usually stick to it to the end.</p>
