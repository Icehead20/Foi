            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Umbrells are Divine Shadower predominantly found within the confines of Urbana.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Their physique is characterized by a semi-circular mass of Shadower tar, supported by two diminutive feet. Adorning their form are two sizable tentacles serving as arms, accompanied by a pair of luminous yellow eyes, one of which hovers above their body. Often, they are spotted sporting a distinctive black hat.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>As clusters of Shadower type B amalgamate, they undergo a growth spurt, expanding in size. Once they reach a critical mass, they congregate and fuse into a singular large entity known as an Umbrell, this birth is marked by the emergence of two luminous yellow eyes that function as the Umbrellâ€™s cerebral center.</p>
			<p>Possessing typical Shadower attributes, Umbrells solidify upon contact with water, succumb if either or both of their eyes are obliterated, and exhibit sluggish movement owing to their viscosity. They can regenerate lost segments by assimilating more Shadower of their kind. Remarkably, they don't require sustenance or hydration, and even if they shed all their mass, they persist as long as their eyes remain intact.</p>
			<p>Recognized for their signature hats, Umbrells exhibit a strong inclination from birth to seek head coverings. These hats are believed to provide protection for their notably exposed eyes, which alongside Darkalas, are among the most vulnerable of all Shadowers. When deprived of their hats, Umbrells experience insecure feelings and a sense of vulnerability, prompting them to swiftly retrieve their lost headgear or locate a suitable replacement.</p>
			<p>Umbrell's floating eye is a characteristic they share with Darkalas and no other Shadower. This characteristic is present from birth. Umbrells can see 360 degrees around them with their floating eye, while their other eye functions normally.</p>
			<p>Because they need to carry their hats with them, Umbrells don't usually submerge fully into Shadower body masses. Instead, they typically keep their heads slightly above to prevent their hats from floating away.</p>
			<p>Umbrells are born with a rudimentary understanding and cognitive capacity akin to that of an adult. Following their birth, they are entrusted to the care of specialized Urbana institutions, which facilitate their integration into society by providing them with a home if possible.</p>
			<p>Umbrells typically exhibit a demeanor characterized by seriousness, mystery, and a penchant for the darker aspects of life. They are often observed traversing the streets in a slow and deliberate manner, eschewing well-lit or familial environments for more secluded areas.</p>
			<p>Umbrells tend to maintain a reserved demeanor amongst themselves, displaying minimal affection and engaging in interaction only when deemed necessary.</p>
			<p>Their enigmatic aura has inspired numerous characters in detective and mobster roles across popular culture worldwide, to the point it has become a stereotype of the species.</p>
			<p>They dominate the hat market, with the large black hat being a favorite for outdoor excursions. However, within the confines of their homes, Umbrells display a wider variety of headwear options.</p>
			<p>Umbrells form the primary demographic of Urbana and serve as its main workforce, contributing significantly to the functionality of the kingdom's businesses. However, they encounter limited job prospects beyond the borders of Urbana.</p>
