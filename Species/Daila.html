            <p>Dailas are Civil Natura CosiPlant J/A that originated on Jupiter. They felt to Earth a long time ago and now primarily live in Forestacha due to its high humidity.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Dailas are anthropomorphic, tree-like creatures with a single red eye. They have brown crust sections resembling clothing and shoes over a black crust. They can grow leaves from their brown sections, but the majority of their leaves are on the branches at the top of their heads.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Originally from Jupiter, Dailas' seeds were cast into space, with most landing on the main Zet continent where the climate was similar to their home planet's domes, allowing them to grow without noticeable changes. Other seeds landed in Borealis, where they adapted to the colder climate and evolved into a different species, the Sailas.</p>
			<p>Like other plants, Dailas absorb energy from the sun using their leaves. They can also consume plant matter but cannot digest meat, which would clog their internal system and cause harm if ingested in large quantities.</p>
			<p>Dailas involuntarily absorb any smoke that comes into contact with them. The smoke is processed by their 'lungs' and expelled as oxygen. Certain types of smoke can have drug-like effects on them.</p>
			<p>Internally, Dailas have organs similar to those of Malormes, including lungs, a stomach, brain, etc, known as "Main Organs." As long as these remain unharmed, the Daila will not die.</p>
			<p>Non-main organ parts of their body can regenerate. Small cuts heal in a few days, larger cuts in a week, and amputated limbs in about a month. More severe injuries take longer to heal depending on the extent of the damage.</p>
			<p>Their eye, along with their leaves, is the only part of their exterior that is not made of wood; it is gelatinous, sensitive, and lacks regenerative abilities, is common for Dailas that lived to old age to haved lost their eyesight.</p>
			<p>Dailas do not have blood; instead, a green liquid emerges from cuts, quickly hardening upon contact with air to seal the wound and protect against infection. This liquid is naturally reabsorbed as the Daila regenerates.</p>
			<p>Physically, Dailas are not built for fast action and have slower movements and reaction times compared to other CosiPlants. Consequently, they avoid physical conflicts, often engaging in psychological warfare instead.</p>
			<p>Dailas reproduce by sharing pollen stored in their mouths, typically through kissing, resulting in one or both parties to produce a seed that carries genes from both parents. Daila sprouts are more tree-like and develop their anthropomorphic features, such as their eye and limbs, as they grow.</p>
			<p>On Earth, Dailas are generally quiet and take time to open up, but they are very loyal once they form friendships. Most Dailas in Forestacha work as lumberjacks and help manage the kingdomâ€™s production, while some live in the southern regions of the Zet Continent.</p>
			<p>Jupiter Dailas are more dominant and active than their Earth counterparts. They are responsible for much of Jupiter's technology and are key players in the planet's society and government. Annually, they release capsules containing their seeds into space, hoping to colonize other worlds. Some of these capsules were the origin of the Earth Dailas.</p>
