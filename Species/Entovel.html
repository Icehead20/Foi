            <p>Entovels are Divine Toys of enormous size that live exclusively in Eslawba.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They have a skull-like head with two large black eyes featuring white pupils. On top of their head is a spike, flanked by two horns on the sides. Their long, spine-like body extends backward, ending in another spike and adorned with rib-like structures along its length.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>The only part of their body that Entovels can move is their eyes; the rest of their body remains motionless, usually lying half-buried in the grounds of Eslawba.</p>
			<p>They don't seem to possess intelligence or much awareness. They don't eat, drink, or sleep, but they do eventually die. When they die, their eyes turn completely black, their skull cracks, and their body starts to disintegrate into dust, except for their ribs, which simply fall off.</p>
			<p>A rib from a dead Entovel can grow like a plant into a new Entovel if conditions are favorable. However, most ribs do not grow fully. If two or more ribs are too close together, they will fuse, halting the growth and killing both. The same occurs if they grow too close to a structure that blocks their growth; any collision stops the growth, leading to disintegration. Due to these growth challenges, fully grown Entovels are rare.</p>
			<p>The gaze of an Entovel has strange effects. Anyone they look at will start to feel sick, nauseous, and will hallucinate floating color rings. These effects last only as long as the person is looking at any part of the Entovel's body after being gazed at.</p>
			<p>When an Entovel gazes at someone, their pupils rapidly change colors to purple, blue, and white. Some say Entovels can emit a laser from their eyes, but this seems to be just a rumor.</p>
			<p>Their origin is unknown, and they appear to have existed since the dawn of time. It is believed that they were created by the goddess for her own entertainment, hence their classification as Divine Toys.</p>
			<p>Entovels have significant cultural importance due to their large size, which has impressed many cultures over the years. Some have been taken out of Eslawba to be revered, particularly in the Desautala region. However, in other regions, they are feared and believed to possess dark powers because of their appearance.</p>
