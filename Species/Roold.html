            <p>Roolds are Civil Natura CosiPlant F/A beings native to the Zet Continent. Originally evolving in the Spain region and spreading to the rest of the Zet Continent. They are one of the two Lañol variants.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Roolds are lengthy, bipedal plant-based creatures, with large arms ending in fingerless mitten-like hands, with only a usable thumb. Their skin is light green, their eyes are typically blue but are usually kept close, they have dark green, fiber-like hair. Their most distinct feature is a “rose skirt”, a petal-like dress formation that grows around their hips and extends down and to the sides. Crowning their heads is the characteristic pink crest with yellow stems, a signature trait of a lot of CosiPlant species.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Originally, the base Lañol species evolved from a giant rose-like flower, likely affected by irregular genetics, which led to their transformation into one of the first Civil CosiPlants species. This same lineage also gave rise to their variants: Tulipod and Roold. These variants can unpredictably appear among offspring, regardless of the parents’ form. It is thought that Roolds rose skirt resembles the giant rose-like flower they evolved from.</p>
			<p>They shared the most characteristics and genetics to the original rose-life flower from all of the Lañol variations, but this causes them to get a lot of genetic and health problems, most notably, the growth of the rose skirt completely deform their legs, leaving them completely unusable and fall off overtime, they are also infertile and their eyes are sensitive so they usually leave them close or barely opened. Other issues include muteness, arms deformities, internal organ issues and psychological issues.</p>
			<p>Their hair, unlike the other Lañol variants, is made of a plant biofiber most similar to other plant species like Purple Guardians, this makes it more silky but more fragile and delicate, most hair products that the other Lañol variants typically use are not compatible with Roolds.</p>
			<p>As Roold mature, “Spikimples” may grow from their skin, these are twirl-like appendages that sometimes sprout leaves. These are harmless but often considered aesthetically undesirable. Improper removal can lead to rough or scarred skin, so professional removal is expensive.</p>
			<p>Young Roold sprouts are placed in large pots during development. They move by hopping while potted. Pulling a young Roold out of its pot prematurely can result in additional growth deformities, but unlike the other Lañol variants, this was often done to try to stop the growth of the rose skirt to avoid the eventual deformities and total leg loss caused by it. But this has never been successful.</p>
			<p>The rose skirt begins as a few layers during childhood and continues growing over time, causing more and more damage to the Roold until they lose their legs completely. Recently, to allow Roolds to keep on moving, Gravity is implanted at the base of their skirt, which allows them to hover around.</p>
			<p>Though they are plant-based, Roolds chlorophyll efficiency decreases with age. While sprouts can absorb sunlight for energy, fully grown Roolds must eat like other species and cannot survive on sunlight alone.</p>
			<p>They also lack regenerative abilities, unlike some other CosiPlant species. If injured or dismembered, they cannot regrow lost limbs or major structures—only the stems on their head consistently regenerate when cut.</p>
			<p>Roolds are badly-regarded for the complications that carry their care and specific needs. Parents usually fear their offspring to be a Roold, and some are known to abandon their offspring if it results to be a Roold.</p>
			<p>Recently there has been less and less Roold, and the chances of their offspring from a Lañol or Tulipod have decreased over time. Only one Roold exists currently, living and working in Spain. Intrusive people have gone to see her like an attraction which she is known to dislike.</p>
