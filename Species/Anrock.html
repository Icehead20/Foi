            <p>Anrock are Civil Divine Wormterrain species found across the world. They are the most common Wormterrain species, alongside their close relatives, the Sarock.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Anrocks are brown, semi-conical dirt creatures resembling small volcanoes. Their hollow bodies feature a crater-like opening at the top. They typically possess black, often frowning eyes and a small mouth.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Distinct from other hand-made Wormterrains of Desautala (such as Shokeimoji-Me and Shokeimoji-Paharo), Borundo No Kamis differ in their overall shape, colors, and capabilities.</p>
			<p>When a group of Wormterrain goo assimilates the rock and dirt of the ground, it becomes alive as a newborn Anrock or Sarock. These newborns have the capacities of a 10 year old child from default. The Wormterrain that produced the goo is considered the parent of the newborn Anrock.</p>
			<p>Anrocks are the most widespread Wormterrain species, as their creation requires only soil—something available virtually everywhere. The location of the first Anrocks is unknown, but they are now distributed across the entire world. It is rare to encounter a community without their presence.</p>
			<p>Anrocks and Sarocks share nearly identical origins and environmental conditions, though Anrocks are 75% more likely to form from Wormterrain assimilated soil. They are the only Wormterrain species known to exhibit such dual-species variation.</p>
			<p>In addition to the standard forms, giant Anrocks and Sarocks occasionally emerge. These rare individuals feature spiked craters and exist only one at a time in the world. Traditionally, they were regarded as leaders of their species, akin to the queens of certain Mutibug species. However, following the Fuse War, most Anrocks abandoned this hierarchy and ceased to follow their giant counterparts.</p>
			<p>The largest Anrock and Sarock capital was once the Voulov Kingdom, which fell into ruin after the Fuse War. Its population scattered, leaving only a small community that now survives mainly through external kingdoms.</p>
			<p>Compared to Sarocks, Anrocks are tougher and more determined. They often speak loudly and display aggressive behavior, both physically and verbally. This has fostered a polarized reputation among other species, resulting in a “love them or hate them” attitude.</p>
			<p>Anrocks can manipulate the dirt composing their bodies, allowing them to move, grasp, and carry objects. While species-specific tools have been developed for their use, they are capable of handling ordinary items without significant difficulty.</p>
			<p>Unlike many other Wormterrain species, Anrocks lack regenerative abilities. Damaged or destroyed body parts cannot be restored.</p>
			<p>Because their bodies are composed of soil, Anrocks do not have a natural lifespan. Well-maintained individuals can live over a century, though most perish earlier due to erosion or accidents of various kinds.</p>
			<p>They do not require food, though they can process certain types but ingesting inappropriate matter may cause blockages or internal damage. Anrocks do not drink, and extensive contact with water destabilizes their bodies, sometimes causing them to collapse. They do, however, sleep—slightly more than the average among other species.</p>
			<p>Between 15 and 25 years after birth, Anrocks begin producing internal goo. Once sufficient goo accumulates, it is expelled through sudden vomiting, creating a new Wormterrain that assimilates whatever it lands on.</p>
			<p>Anrocks can open their lower halves to absorb soil and other matter beneath them, compact it, and launch it from their crater like a cannonball. If they attempt to absorb large indigestible material, it can cause intense pain comparable to a sharp blow.</p>
			<p>Historically, Anrocks have filled roles in manufacturing and heavy labor. Some also pursue professional careers and attain high ranks. Nevertheless, unemployment and crime remain widespread among some communities.</p>
