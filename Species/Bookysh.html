            <p>Bookysh are Natura Oceans Malerceans that inhabit the sea, typically staying near the surface.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are small orange creatures with a pair of yellow fins on their backs. They have a donut-shaped gland around them, which varies in pattern and color from one individual to another, though the most common design is white with red stripes.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>They breathe air, storing it in the donut-shaped gland around their bodies, known as their 'lifesaver' gland. This gland allows them to slowly consume the stored air while they dive underwater.</p>
			<p>Since they can't store much air, they spend most of their time at the sea's surface where they can breathe and rest. The lifesaver gland helps keep their upper half buoyant, but staying at the surface makes them vulnerable to predators and other dangers.</p>
			<p>Bookysh dive underwater mainly when they sense danger at the surface or to find food. They eat marine vegetation and microorganisms, but because they can't stay underwater for long, they are usually found in shallow areas where vegetation is more accessible.</p>
			<p>Their upper half is covered in scale-like structures, which are actually small glands that expel excess water while they float on the surface.</p>
			<p>Bookysh can burst their lifesaver gland to escape dangerous situations, giving them a temporary boost. However, this leaves them extremely vulnerable, and if they are underwater, they will start to drown. Thus, they only do this in extreme circumstances.</p>
			<p>The lifesaver gland can regenerate in about a day, during which the Bookysh must stay on the surface manually. Other Bookysh often help by carrying the injured one and keeping it afloat.</p>
			<p>Bookysh and Genefi are the primary food sources for many predators in the sea because they are easy to catch and abundant.</p>
			<p>Bookysh reproduce rapidly, they lack breeding seasons and reproduce at any time, a single pair of Bookysh can produce up to 300 offspring a month.</p>
			<p>Bookysh eggs are small and buoyant, staying afloat until they hatch. When they hatch, the offspring don't fully emerge right away; they break the egg just enough to let air in and observe their surroundings. They remain partially inside the egg for about a week, only fully emerging if they sense a dangerous situation.</p>
			<p>The design of their lifesaver gland inspired the creation of the actual lifesaver used on boats worldwide.</p>
