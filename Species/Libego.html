            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Libego are Divine Leftovers that originate extremely rarely in pitch-dark areas of the universe.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are simple in shape, being an orange pill-shaped, mid-sized creature with a small mouth with a small white fang in their front side and V shaped flames coming out of their top, which is their main differentiator from the similar Capegos.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Libegos generate with a 0.00000001% probability per minute in pitch-dark areas. They generally generate in caves underground, at midnight in solitary areas, in the void of space, or in the depths of the ocean.</p>
			<p>If a Libego’s flame is put out, it will immediately perish. This means Libegos that generate underwater or in space perish immediately after coming into existence. It is theorized that some asteroids in space are actually corpses of Libegos floating in space.</p>
			<p>Libego’s sentience is debated. They seem to be completely emotionless and unaware of their surroundings. They don’t seem to have needs of any kind and maintain the same expression no matter what happens to them.</p>
			<p>When a Libego is generated, they will float mindlessly and directionless until they sense the presence of a Civil creature in the surrounding area. They will lock onto it and start following them, bumping into them, which is dangerous to the locked-on creature because of the flames of the Libego. Libego doesn’t follow non-Civil creatures nor artificial beings.</p>
			<p>Once a Libego is locked onto someone, they will follow them even if they hide behind objects. However, if the Libego isn’t physically capable of bumping into their objective, they will desist and start floating mindlessly until they lock onto another being. They will not lock onto the same being unless an hour has passed and the being is still in their surroundings.</p>
			<p>Libego meat holds barely any nutritional value or taste and is bland. Their whole body is composed entirely of muscle, and the interior of their mouth doesn’t lead to anything, making it more like just a hole. Their meat can be consumed but is recommended only as a last resort.</p>
			<p>While alive, Libego are immune to their own fire and those of other Libegos, but they can be affected by external fire. When they die, they immediately lose these properties. It is recommended to hunt them with a long-range weapon and consume them roasted to maximize their very little health factor in case of need.</p>
			<p>When a Libego perishes, their fire will also immediately extinguish. This fire is special; it only needs oxygen to exist and doesn’t usually spread over to other things, not even the driest of branches. This fire hurts to the touch but less than other conventional fires.</p>
			<p>In the past, they’ve been both consumed and praised as deities, especially in Terraido and sections of the Zet Continent. The meat of some Libegos was cooked in the flames of captured Capegos for consumption in rituals, and their meat was also used in medicines of debated efficiency. Leaders of these communities crave having a Libego following them as a sign of holy power.</p>
			<p>Even though they share similarities and the same origin, Libegos and Capegos are considered different species. They don’t interact in any meaningful way with each other, even though it was once believed that Libegos were the leader or superior version of Capegos.</p>
			<p>Currently, it’s common for the police or guards of every region to take care of Libego sightings. Usually, artificial members handle them, but it is not obligatory. Since they offer no resistance, the usual method to take them out is to penetrate them with a lance or long-reach weapon to dispose of their body or use them with other ingredients to make cattle food. Seeing a Libego under any circumstance is considered a bad omen and a sign of death. They are seen as dangerous and creepy creatures.</p>
			<p>Libegos originated as a by-product of the sword of the goddess Forge. It is said that the clashes of its sword generated flaming sparks that became Libegos and Capegos. Some believe they were the creation of the goddess Lava because of their relation to fire. Both theories are considered equally plausible as both goddesses are related to flames. Some theorize it is both at the same time, as it is thought Lava made Forge’s sword. It's thought that Libego especially were made to follow the attacking objective of Forge and inflict damage on them with their fire.</p>
