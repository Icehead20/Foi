            <p>Crirok are Civil Artificial Crystalogy that were created and reside in Plus Mountain. They stand out as one of the most neglected and scarce civil species, both among artificial entities and in general.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Criroks are simple, pointy purple crystal entities with basic black 'eyes.' Their structure includes a silver metal rocket motor mechanism at the base, housing all their mechanical components. This motor emits flames from the bottom orifice, facilitating the movement of the Crirok.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Criroks are created using the Plus Mountain's Purple Crystals as the main power source, incorporating mechanical robotic parts to harness and shape this energy into a form of life. The black mechanical eyes are the main responsible in converting the crystal's energy into life, and damage to this component can lead to irreparable harm to the Crirok.</p>
			<p>The Purple Crystal, besides serving as an energy source, also acts as storage for their memories and personalities. Any damage to this part can result in mental issues and other complications.</p>
			<p>During the combustion process and ignition of their rocket when it's activated, a byproduct is produced, which is absorbed by the Crirok's Purple Crystal, providing increased durability and resistance that allows them to withstand falls and collisions at high speeds.</p>
			<p>Criroks have the ability to control their rockets, although their precision and control are suboptimal, leading to frequent collisions and accidental property damage. Some Gravitry is integrated into their rocket design, enabling them to slightly manipulate objects in their vicinity. However, this ability is among the least effective compared to other species using similar Gravitry techniques.</p>
			<p>Criroks are the very last models in the Crystalogy line, created as experiments and swiftly discontinued due to their inherent flaws. They proved to be less capable than Oviby in every aspect, with a penchant for causing harm due to their erratic movements. The rapid discontinuation and lack of societal and structural accommodation for them in Plus Mountain have resulted in Criroks being neglected, making them be regard as the least supported Civil species in the world.</p>
			<p>Criroks lack specific assigned jobs, and they often fly around the mountain, contributing to their unpopularity among other species in Plus Mountain. Due to their destructive tendencies, they have been quietly banned from most other kingdoms, although this ban is not widely known, even among Criroks themselves.</p>
			<p>In the event of an invasion or attack, Criroks are instructed to collide with the threat at high speeds to maximize damage to the enemy.</p>
			<p>Many Criroks exhibit symptoms similar to ADHD, and the exact cause, whether from their crystal, robotic parts, or other factors, remains unknown.</p>
