            <p>Doblead are Natura CosiPlants S/A that inhabit the forest regions of Spain and its surroundings.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are green plant creatures with a base formed from small, tentacle-like structures. From this base, two long, neck-like structures with spikes on their backs extend. At the end of these necks are two slightly different heads: one with a white eye and 'flesh teeth', and the other with a white pupil and black iris, featuring a mouth with white teeth. Both heads have a snout and a pink flower on top.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Doblead wander the forests of Spain and surrounding areas in search of prey. Historically, they were mostly found in the old forest regions of France before those areas were destroyed, forcing them to migrate. Their original name was 'Double head,' but over time, this name, mockingly pronounced with a french accent by the La√±ols of Spain, evolved into 'Doblead'.</p>
			<p>Both heads can communicate internally as if reading each other's minds, but they cannot communicate with other species or even other members of their own species, aside from basic head gestures and growls.</p>
			<p>They move slowly using the tentacle-like structures at their base. When hungry, they search for small creatures like birds but will not hesitate to attack larger creatures if given the chance, they are even known to attack people who get lost in the forest.</p>
			<p>Doblead sneak quietly towards their prey and, when close enough, choose their mode of attack. Depending on what seems most effective, the head with the completely white eyes can attack wildly and aggressively, while the other head can analyze the prey's weak points and bite them rapidly. If both heads' attacks seem effective, they default to using the completely white-eyed head.</p>
			<p>The flesh teeth of the completely white-eyed head can regenerate if broken, while the teeth of the other head lack this ability so it takes care of them and makes sure not to damage them.</p>
			<p>To reproduce, Doblead rubs the flowers on their heads with other members of their species, exchanging pollen that gathers DNA. This starts a process where one to two seeds develop internally inside both Doublead, during which the Dobleads are considered 'pregnant'. Heads of the same Doblead cannot impregnate each other.</p>
			<p>A pregnant Doblead will hunt less than usual, and as the seeds grow inside them, they search for a good spot to dig a small hole. About one to two months after becoming pregnant, they expel the seeds from below their base and bury them in the hole. After giving birth, Doblead rests for two days to a week before resuming their usual activities. They usually find a spot protected by vegetation deep in the forest or in a cave, where both heads curl up and rest. If disturbed during this resting period, the completely white-eyed head will attack aggressively and mindlessly to scare off intruders, often injuring itself in the process.</p>
			<p>A Doblead sprout initially shows only the pink flower at the top of its head above ground. It develops underground until it reaches a small size, then both heads emerge to catch bugs and small prey until their base has grown enough to be able to completely get out of the ground and walk. Adult Doblead will share food with any sprout Doblead they encounter, even those not directly related to them, often leaving large chunks of meat for the sprouts to feed on for days.</p>
			<p>Doblead are closely related to Envivors, who in turn are related to the much older and long-lived Reink species.</p>
