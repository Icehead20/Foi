            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Luvokise are Natura Birds Pluvers that embark on a global migration, surrounded by numerous legends.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>These small pink creatures possess a pair of pink wings adorned with darker pink patterns, a lengthy pink tail, and their most notable characteristicâ€”an heart-shaped head.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>These creatures exhibit a strong sense of community, travelling in flocks and staying united except during the mating events, when friendly competition for mates ensues.</p>
			<p>Luvokise employ their renowned head shape in their mating dance, where they sway it from side to side to impress potential mates. Interestingly, both males and females exhibit this heart-shaped head, though the females don't seem to utilize it during the courtship ritual.</p>
			<p>Their migratory route spans from the top to the bottom of the Prime Continent, proceeding through the Zet Continent from right to left before returning to their starting point. During their travels, Luvokise deposit eggs in designated areas called "Egg points." These zones contain numerous nests where they rest and leave eggs, hoping that they will hatch in the future and join the group during subsequent passages.</p>
			<p>Luvokise eggs are unique, possessing excellent heat absorption capabilities. This adaptation allows them to survive when no Luvokise are present to incubate them in constantly. Althought, some Luvokise usually remain at the egg points, tending to all the eggs and striving to ensure their survival until they hatch. When the flock returns to the egg point the hatched Luvokise will join the flock, the Luvokise nursering the eggs will rejoin the flock too and be replace with diferent Luvokise who will stay to take care of the new laid eggs after the mating of the adults of flock.</p>
			<p>Witnessed by various civilizations throughout history, Luvokise have inspired diverse myths. In The Politemia, they were initially regarded as beautiful birds, later serving as a chronological reference for the regional system of years, months, and days.</p>
			<p>In Polsize, Resize, and Coconut Island, they were treated as deities that were praised, and celebrations were made in their honor when they passed by. However, in Resize, people in positions of power secretly consumed them in an attempt to obtain divine powers.</p>
			<p>In Mexico, it was believed that keeping one in captivity brought luck and good fortune, especially in matters of love. Nowadays, the myth has evolved, and if one is seen, it is considered a symbol of luck in love.</p>
			<p>For The Queen of The Chess Kingdom, Prinssne, Luvokise represent a form of happiness and beauty for her soul.</p>
			<p>In the majority of the Second Kingdom, Luvokise are considered legendary birds that are rarely encountered. There were myths portraying them as dangerous beings, leading to minimal contact with them until it was proven otherwise by later studies.</p>
			<p>Luvokise kept in captivity will stress out and act erratically. If kept in this state for too long, the risk of heart failure increases. One way to alleviate this and trick the Luvokise into a calmer state is to place a nest with fake eggs close to them. This will deceive the Luvokise into thinking that they are on an egg point and encourage them to take care of the false eggs, anticipating the hatching and return of their flock. However, prolonged use of this method can lead to the development of symptoms resembling depression in the Luvokise.</p>
			<p>Despite their cultural significance in many regions, Luvokise are an endangered species, due to the destruction and deforestation of their egg zones, along with hunting, and theft of their eggs for culinary and religious purposes, all of which have led to a decline in the species' population.</p>
			<p>They haved become a protected species in the last decades, hunting, disrupting their migration cycle, collecting their eggs, and destroying their nests are strictly prohibited.</p>
