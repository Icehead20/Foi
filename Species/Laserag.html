            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Laserag are Civil Artificial Crystalogy that were created and primarily reside in Plus Mountain where they work as segurity guards and incinerators.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They're light grey cylinders with only a hole in their bottom end, on their sides they have with Mutibug-like wings and on their front they have a singular usually frowned eye.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Laserag are created using the Plus Mountain's Purple Crystals as the main power source, incorporating mechanical robotic parts to harness and shape this energy into a form of life. They have their Purple Crystal stored internally at the top of their head and their singular mechanical eye is the main responsible in converting it's energy into life, damage to their eye can lead to irreparable harm to the Laserag.</p>
			<p>The Purple Crystal, besides serving as an energy source, also acts as storage for their memories and personalities. Any damage to this part can result in mental issues and other complications.</p>
			<p>They were created by combining First Kingdom's '4DF2B Useful' Cannon, with the power of Purple Crystals and general Crystalogy technology which resulted in a formidable creature capable of wielding one of the strongest laser cannons in the world, surpassed only by Shutery's Cannon, the princess of the Mountain Range Minun.</p>
			<p>The Purple Crystal within a Laserag powers the firing of the 4DF2B Useful Cannon, enhancing its energy output and enabling continuous firing for an extended period. The laser beam is released through a hole located at their bottom.</p>
			<p>Laserags navigate through the air using wings, though they are slower and less agile in flight compared to later Crystalogy models like the Ovibys. They primarily serve as security guards within the Plus Mountain society, and some are engaged in incinerating scraps and garbage with their powerful laser beams, turning waste into ashes.</p>
			<p>Their eyes default to a frowning expression but can change to other expressions with active thought. If not actively controlled, the expression reverts to the default, creating an in-between capability compared to the more expressive Spoons and the limited expressions of other Crystalogys like Cristalife.</p>
			<p>Laserags are often met with an uncanny feeling due to their in-between expression ability, leading to a sense of rejection among non-artificial species. However, they find greater acceptance among other Crystalogy.</p>
			<p>Known for their serious and no-nonsense attitude, Laserags are dedicated to the tasks assigned to them. During periods of rest, they enjoy wrapping their wings around themselves in cold areas, often congregating with other Laserags. Specialized resting places in Plus Mountain feature rows of Laserags lined up like wine bottles in refrigerated chambers.</p>
			<p>The production of Laserags is closely monitored by both kingdoms involved in their creation, given their high destructive potential. Laserags that leave the Mountain are also discreetly observed to ensure the safetly of the population.</p>
