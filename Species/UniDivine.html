            <p>UniDivine are Divine Leftovers that function more as a classification of individuals sharing similar characteristics than as a conventional biological species.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>UniDivine do not possess a unified appearance; instead, their forms vary drastically from one individual to another.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>UniDivine are one of the four “Dark Undefined” species, a group defined by the absence of a unified morphology or direct biological relation, beyond a set of shared defining characteristics.</p>
			<p>The term UniDivine refers to unique divine entities that exist in numbers too small to be considered a true species. These beings possess morphologies entirely distinct from other creatures—though they may physically resemble existing species—and typically have an unknown origin, or one that is directly connected to the Goddess in some form. Many UniDivine are the monster form of Goddesses, with the Goddesses themselves also being classified as UniDivine.</p>
			<p>UniDivine generally wield powers that surpass or outright defy the laws of nature. However, the extent, nature, and practical application of these abilities vary greatly between individuals.</p>
			<p>UniDivine are generally incapable of reproduction. Some, however, can create other beings from themselves. Depending on the properties of these offspring, they may either be classified as UniDivine or recognized as an independent species. This distinction is typically determined by whether the offspring can reproduce autonomously, the number of offspring produced, and whether their creation causes degeneration on the progenitor. If continued creation would render the progenitor nonviable over time, the offspring are not considered a separate species and remain classified as UniDivine.</p>
			<p>Most, if not all, UniDivine are immortal and appear unaffected by aging, with many existing for hundreds of years. Throughout history, they have played significant roles in shaping both historical events and political landscapes. Despite their longevity, UniDivine are not invulnerable and can be damaged or killed through physical or other means.</p>
			<p>Some examples of UniDivine creatures:</p>
			<p>Snow, Queen of Snow Mountain, possesses the ability to create Snow creatures, which are considered their own distinct branch of species. Her body shares similarities with ordinary snow, but is far stronger and does not melt, making it distinct both from natural snow and from her creations.</p>
			<p>Alaska Snow, the mountain ruled by Snow, is not considered part of the Snow species. It is a unique entity incapable of reproduction, and its origin is not the result of direct creation by Snow, but rather the manifestation of elements of her former goddess identity externalized into a creature.</p>
			<p>Sonof, Queen of Forestacha, despite her strong resemblance to the Frêirak species, is not morphologically classified as one. As the monster form of the Goddess Queen Queen Queen, she is considered a distinct entity and falls under the UniDivine classification.</p>
			<p>Octopus, also known as Octomutan or Necropuss, is one of the beasts of the sea across its various incarnations. Only a single individual has existed for thousands of years, appearing incapable of reproduction and demonstrating extreme resistance to damage.</p>
			<p>Giganbow resembles Rainets and Rainbowtears and is even capable of creating them, yet remains distinct from them in its properties. It is considered one of the few truly fully immortal beings, as its body will always reconstitute itself a fixed number of years after destruction. Giganbow was a significant figure in ancient cultures and frequently fought in coliseums.</p>
			<p>Lanae, an inhabitant of Rosaldew, possesses paint-based abilities and has created an offspring from herself at the cost of losing a portion of her own being. This offspring would suffer the same limitation if it attempted similar reproduction, preventing the emergence of a sustainable species. As a result, neither are classified as a separate species. Lanae is notable for being one of the few UniDivine to live as a regular civilian, despite her widespread fame.</p>
			<p>The First Kings and Diamonch, while consisting of multiple individuals with shared physical traits and properties, are not considered a species. They lack a reproductive mechanism and display sufficient morphological variation among members to prevent classification as a single race.</p>
			<p>Music Cube, ruler of Masaland, is capable of creating bodies; however, these constructs lack souls and have never resembled their creator. It is theorized that Music Cube could create a body with identical properties to its own and, if a soul were introduced, this might constitute a form of reproduction. However, such an event has never been observed.</p>
			<p>Some examples of non-UniDivine are:</p>
			<p>Motheria, Queen of Urbana, who is capable of reproduction and shares sufficient similarities with her offspring to be classified within a single group. She is considered a Genower under the Shadower classification.</p>
			<p>R. Island, King of Reverse Island, along with the island itself, is capable of reproducing by creating creatures from its own flesh without suffering degeneration. Although the offspring vary in appearance, they share core morphology and properties with their creator, resulting in their classification under the Reverse species.</p>
			<p>Scissors, despite possessing powers comparable to those of UniDivine, is not classified as one, as it bears no relation to the Goddess and is instead a member of The Logic.</p>
