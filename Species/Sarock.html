            <p>Sarock are Civil Divine Wormterrain species found across the world. They are one of the most common Wormterrain species, right behind their close relatives, the Anrock.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Sarocks are yellow, semi-conical dirt creatures resembling small volcanoes. Their hollow bodies feature a crater-like opening at the top. They typically possess black, often saddened eyes and a small mouth.</p>

			<p>When a group of Wormterrain goo assimilates the rock and dirt of the ground, it becomes alive as a newborn Anrock or Sarock. These newborns have the capacities of a 10 year old child from default. The Wormterrain that produced the goo is considered the parent of the newborn Sarock.</p>
			<p>Sarocks are one of the most widespread Wormterrain species, as their creation requires only soil—something available virtually everywhere. The location of the first Sarocks is unknown, but they are now distributed across the entire world. It is rare to encounter a community without their presence.</p>
			<p>Anrocks and Sarocks share nearly identical origins and environmental conditions, though Sarocks are only 25% more likely to form from Wormterrain assimilated soil. They are the only Wormterrain species known to exhibit such dual-species variation.</p>
			<p>In addition to the standard forms, giant Anrocks and Sarocks occasionally emerge. These rare individuals feature spiked craters and exist only one at a time in the world. Traditionally, they were regarded as leaders of their species, akin to the queens of certain Mutibug species. However, following the Fuse War, most Sarocks abandoned this hierarchy and ceased to follow their giant counterparts.</p>
			<p>The largest Anrock and Sarock capital was once the Voulov Kingdom, which fell into ruin after the Fuse War. Its population scattered, leaving only a small community that now survives mainly through external kingdoms.</p>
			<p>Compared to Anrocks, Sarocks are weaker and more sensible emotionally. They are often shy and speak quietly, even the soil of their body is somehow less resistant than Anrock’s. This has fostered a polarized reputation among other species, since they are seen as lesser, weak and winey, but some get to accept them for how they are, resulting in a “love them or hate them” attitude towards the species.</p>
			<p>Sarocks can manipulate the dirt composing their bodies, allowing them to move, grasp, and carry objects. While species-specific tools have been developed for their use, they are capable of handling ordinary items without significant difficulty.</p>
			<p>Unlike many other Wormterrain species, Sarocks lack regenerative abilities. Damaged or destroyed body parts cannot be restored.</p>
			<p>Because their bodies are composed of soil, Sarocks do not have a natural lifespan. Well-maintained individuals can live over a century, though most perish earlier due to erosion or accidents of various kinds. Comparatively to Anrocks, Sarocks have more probabilities to perish due to erosion.</p>
			<p>They do not require food, though they can process certain types but ingesting inappropriate matter may cause blockages or internal damage. Sarocks do not drink, and extensive contact with water destabilizes their bodies, sometimes causing them to collapse. They do, however, sleep—slightly more than the average among other species.</p>
			<p>Between 15 and 25 years after birth, Sarocks begin producing internal goo. Once sufficient goo accumulates, it is expelled through sudden vomiting, creating a new Wormterrain that assimilates whatever it lands on. Sarock’s parenting is admired by other species for their kindness and tolerance with their offsprings.</p>
			<p>Sarocks can open their lower halves to absorb soil and other matter beneath them, compact it in the form of a cone, and launch it from their crater like a spike. If they attempt to absorb large indigestible material, it can cause intense pain comparable to a sharp blow.</p>
			<p>Historically, Sarocks have filled roles in manufacturing, especially textiles. Some also pursue professional careers and attain high ranks. They are one of the Wormterrain species with the most members working on high profile careers.</p>
