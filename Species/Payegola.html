            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Payegola are Natura Oceans Finers that reside on the seas of Mareala and the southern regions of Detlol. They share a close relationship with the Alegolas.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Payegolas are characterized by their small orange bodies featuring distinctive white stripes. They possess two large eyes with a black stripe below them and a big red nose, and fins adorned with intricate white patterns.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Payegolas boast a jaw capable of unexpectedly extending up to three times its size, enabling them to deliver powerful bites with a force of 275 kg per cm2. This ability allows them to confront and triumph over most adversaries they encounter. Once eaten, their stomach acid swiftly dissolves whatever they consume.</p>
			<p>Without hesitation, Payegolas snap and consume anything that ventures near them. Their potent stomach acid breaks down all substances into their fundamental particles, granting them the capability to devour even ships and unconventional materials.</p>
			<p>Their keen vision enables them to discern small details and detect suspicious movements from considerable distances in their surroundings. However, their visual acuity diminishes significantly in low-light conditions.</p>
			<p>Their swimming abilities are limited; they struggle to achieve high speeds and typically need to build momentum gradually. In the face of strong currents, they often find themselves carried along, unable to resist the force of the water.</p>
			<p>During daylight hours, most marine creatures have learned to steer clear of Payegolas. Only the swifter and more cunning predators dare to approach them and attempt to feed on them in broad daylight.</p>
			<p>At night, Payegolas are forced to rest due to their digestive system. While resting, they secrete excess stomach acid, but once it's expelled from their bodies, its properties are neutralized. This period of rest leaves them vulnerable to attacks from predators, so they often seek refuge in vegetation to avoid being targeted.</p>
			<p>Payegolas can live long lives, some of the longest among the Finers’ species. However, they only reproduce during the first half of their lifespan. In the latter half, they focus on protecting the eggs and offspring of their own descendants and the descendants of those.</p>
			<p>The offspring of Payegolas are weak and lack the biting ability of their adult counterparts, making them easy prey. They typically hide in vegetation until they are able to extend their mouths to at least double their size before venturing out. Usually, at this point, their big red nose grows out, indicating their more mature state.</p>
			<p>Payegolas maintain a close relationship with the Alegolas.</p>
			<p>During a crisis caused by the oil split in Detlol their old habitad, Payegolas faced hunger for the dead of their prey and started to deplet in numbers. Survivors migrated eastward, encountering the Alegolas which were in a similar situation. Both species formed a symbiotic relationship: Alegolas safeguarded the Payegolas, who reciprocated by providing sustenance and protection against predators. At night, Alegolas protected the resting Payegolas.</p>
			<p>Subsequently, both species migrated north once stability was achieved.</p>
			<p>Currently, Alegolas hunt Genefis among other species near Still River.</p>
			<p>Their unique relationship and history were discovered by a team initially intending to document the effects of the oil split in Detlol. However, upon the unexpected discovery of the Payegolas and Alegolas, the documentary's focus shifted, capturing their story over years, now renowned worldwide.</p>
