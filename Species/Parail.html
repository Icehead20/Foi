            <p>Parails are Natura Oceans Corralis that function as parasites within remarkably long-lived organisms.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Parails exhibit a curved structure with small surface craters, displaying a range of colors such as blue or orange. At one of their ends, they feature roots characterized by a reddish hue bordered by pink, jelly-like outlines.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>These creatures germinate from a spore-like formation consisting of a cluster of microorganisms. Upon adhering to the skin of another creature, they initiate reproduction and develop roots that firmly attach deep within the host's skin, termed the 'driver.' Gradually, the Parail grows its curved section upwards, culminating in the release of spores to generate another Parail.</p>
			<p>The roots of the Parail draw nutrients from the host in a manner that sustains the parasite without fatally compromising the host, although it may induce health issues in the driver.</p>
			<p>It takes a staggering 1000 years for a Parail to reach full maturity, rendering it unable to reproduce until that stage. This characteristic poses a significant threat to the species, as the death of its driver results in the demise of the Parail. However, the number of creatures surviving for the necessary duration is extremely limited. Presently, only three fully mature Parail species exist in the wild, predominantly found in the head region of a great Yark, referred to as 'Mobylon'.</p>
			<p>The slow growth rate of Parail has hindered the research efforts of the First Kingdom, resulting in limited progress and no substantial breakthroughs thus far.</p>
			<p>Should the Parail's roots intertwine with the nerves of its driver, it can grant the ability for the driver to exert slight voluntary movement over the curved section of the Parail.</p>
