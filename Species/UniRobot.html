            <p>UniRobot are Artificial UniRobot, entities that function more as a classification of individuals sharing a single defining characteristic than as a standardized species.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>UniRobot do not possess a unified appearance; instead, their forms vary drastically from one individual to another.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>UniRobot are one of the two “Dark Undefined” species, a group defined by the absence of a unified morphology or direct biological relation, beyond a set of shared defining characteristics.</p>
			<p>The term UniRobot refers to unique robotic entities that exist but were never produced in mass as a standardized model by any form of manufacture. As a result, each UniRobot is a completely unique individual, distinct both from one another and from mass-produced robotic models.</p>
			<p>UniRobots exhibit a wide range of forms and characteristics depending on the individual. Whether created in Eslawba, independently, through unknown means, or by other methods, any robotic entity that exists in only one or a very limited number of units —without mass production— falls under the UniRobot classification. Discontinued robotic models do not qualify as UniRobots.</p>
			<p>Because most UniRobots are designed for highly specialized purposes, they are generally more powerful than mass-produced robotic models. However, this specialization also results in significant disadvantages: repairs and spare parts are not widely available, requiring most UniRobots to employ or be assigned specialized technicians to address damage, maintenance, and system failures.</p>
			<p>If a UniRobot were to be mass-produced or were to develop a method of reproduction, it would be reclassified as its own species and would no longer be considered a UniRobot.</p>
			<p>In recent times, the creation of UniRobots has become heavily regulated by moral committees, in contrast to earlier eras. As a result, most UniRobots were created before such regulations were established, with only a few having been constructed afterward. These regulations were implemented to prevent the creation of entities with destructive capabilities, unethical design features, or problematic levels of sentience.</p>
			<p>As with all artificial species, UniRobots must be conscious and sentient to be considered a species. If a non-sentient robot were to gain consciousness, and this change was not generalized across all robots of its model, it would be classified as a UniRobot.</p>
			<p>Some examples of UniRobot creatures:</p>
			<p>B.I.G.C.R., Governor of The Bubble, was created independently by the inhabitants of The Bubble as an ideal ruler following a prolonged period of political corruption. Designed to resemble the Cr species, its independent creation and awkward levels of sentience and self-awareness are considered problematic.</p>
			<p>Mekamecha, one of the beasts of the sea, is a large, elongated entity capable of firing a powerful laser from its mouth, having destroyed thousands of boats. Of unknown origin, it is believed that only one exists in the deep ocean.</p>
			<p>Carruach is a mysterious robot illegally created in the robot factories of Eslawba. It later wandered through Necrosela before being damaged in Voulov, after which it became known as “Molten Carruach”.</p>
			<p>Natieer, governor of Coast Rich, was commissioned from the robot factories of Eslawba and inspired by B.I.G.C.R., featuring an original design developed by the inhabitants of Coast Rich. It was among the last UniRobots created prior to the enforcement of the regulations.</p>
			<p>Exoteligence is a specialized UniRobot whose design resembles a Mekamind, but with levitation capabilities and other design features. It possesses experimental functions allowing control over Euwa’s internal facilities and maintains a direct connection to the new internet.</p>
