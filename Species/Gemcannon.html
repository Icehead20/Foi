            <p>Gemcannon are Civil Artificial Crystalogy that were created and primarly reside in Plus Mountain where they work as guards.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Gemcannons are medium-sized creatures characterized by their grey heads, which feature two large elongated yellow eyes with cross marks pointing at their small pupils and their mouth. They have darker grey feet at the sides and an elongated cannon on the top back of their head, which is their distinctive feature.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Gemcannons are created using the Plus Mountain's Purple Crystals as the main power source, incorporating mechanical robotic parts to harness and shape this energy into a form of life. They have their Purple Crystal stored internally at the core of their head along side all their main energy convertion mechanisms.</p>
			<p>The Purple Crystal, besides serving as an energy source, also acts as storage for their memories and personalities. Any damage to this part can result in mental issues and other complications.</p>
			<p>Gemcannons were created using recovered technology from the War invasion after their defeat, specifically incorporating technology from their ships along with DNA from the species known as "Absoraw," in conjunction with Purple Crystal technology. This unique combination of biological elements and advanced technology has led some to consider Gemcannons as cyborgs or similar entities.</p>
			<p>Gemcannons possess near-perfect aim, facilitated by their highly advanced eyes, which enable them to precisely locate their target. They swiftly rotate and expel one of their crystals from the cannon atop their back, launching it towards the target with remarkable accuracy, akin to a lance.</p>
			<p>The crystals produced by Gemcannons thanks to their Absoraw organs, resemble Purple Crystals in appearance but lack their properties. These crystals are notably more transparent and fragile, they're known as "Blast Gems".</p>
			<p>Gemcannons can produce Blast Gems within 30 seconds to a minute after the release of the last one. Due to being engineered for rapid creation and deployment, these crystals do not attain the size or strength of those produced naturally by Absoraw in the wild. Additionally, Blast Gems lack the unique qualities possessed by the ones that Absoraw produce.</p>
			<p>Gemcannons were among the earliest experiments in harnessing War technology. They possess some of the fastest mechanical brains and exhibit extremely rapid reaction speeds, owing to components salvaged from War ships. Absoraw organs are cultivated in laboratories and integrated into their design, allowing Gemcannons to produce Blast Gems at will.</p>
			<p>Their original role was to serve as guards in Plus Mountain, tasked with neutralizing threats using their Blast Crystals. Despite their effectiveness, they were eventually mostly supplanted by Laserag and Ovibys. As a result, their production has not ceased but has significantly slowed down, with limited numbers being produced in modern times.</p>
			<p>Although Gemcannons are considered a triumph in achieving their intended purpose, there are those who question the this set purpose and their desing in general for not being optimal for a living creature. This perspective has led some to view Gemcannons as a failure in desing and in terms of their broader societal impact, contributing to their current limited production.</p>
			<p>Gemcannons are known for their confident demeanor and wide grin. It's rare to find a Gemcannon that isn't cheerful and laughing at their own jokes. However, this jovial disposition isn't necessarily good. Negative feelings are often replaced with manic tendencies, leading to them being vigilated in certain sectors.</p>
			<p>Due to their exceptional accuracy, certain criminal organizations have attempted to enlist Gemcannons for illegal activities and as hired assassins. However, given their remote location and limited accessibility, these endeavors have not been particularly successful.</p>
			<p>Gemcannons who are no longer employed as guards often transition to roles in entertainment, serving as actors, work on  advertising, or customer service representatives, leveraging their cheerful demeanor and charisma to their advantage.</p>
