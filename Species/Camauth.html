            <p>Camauths are Natura Oceans Malerceans that inhabit the open seas of Mareala, always in the company of a leading Bigmauch.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are rounded blue creatures covered with lumps all across their bodies. They have two small fins at their sides, a larger back fin, and a large mouth equipped with numerous sharp fangs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Camauths reside in groups comprising 9 to 14 members, each group under the guidance of a Bigmauch leader.</p>
			<p>Their primary pursuit involves hunting Balleys, executing attacks by biting and immobilizing the Balleys' fins and tail. The leader Bigmauch then delivers the decisive blow.</p>
			<p>Displaying an exceedingly aggressive demeanor toward perceived threats, they remain loyal and subservient to their leader Bigmauch in all situations.</p>
			<p>While capable of consuming smaller prey when hungry, they display a preference for hunting Balleys and avoid alternative sources of food whenever possible.</p>
			<p>Repeated reproduction between Camauths and their respective Bigmauch leaders has led to deformities (manifested as their characteristic body lumps) in the offspring of both species over time.</p>
			<p>The origins of the relationship between Camauths and Bigmauchs remain shrouded in mystery.</p>
			<p>Camauths communicate within their species by generating vibrations through the grinding of their teeth. These vibrations convey messages and signals that are understood by other Camauths.</p>
			<p>The corpses of Camauths exhibit a peculiar fertility, contributing to the growth of underwater vegetation in the areas they inhabit. Their remains aid in fostering the growth and sustenance of aquatic flora.</p>
			<p>They are widely deemed as sea pests, Camauths are unwelcome entities across various regions worldwide.</p>
