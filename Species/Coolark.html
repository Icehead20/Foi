            <p>Coolark are Divine Leftovers that inhabit exclusively the deserts of Resize.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>These elongated blue creatures have crystal-like structures resembling ice protruding from all over their bodies, including small claws made of the same material. Their sharp heads lack eyes but feature eye hole-like depressions where eyes would normally be. Three teardrop-shaped rocks are embedded in their foreheads. The ends of their bodies open into small, tentacle-like limbs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Coolark can only be seen and are active during cold nights in the deserts of Resize. During the day, they become translucent and intangible, remaining stationary and perched on nearby rocks or structures, using their tentacles to hold on.</p>
			<p>A Coolark can only exist in Resize or Polsize; if forced to leave these areas, they will melt, leaving only a puddle of water behind.</p>
			<p>Coolarks are generated when the cold south winds collide with the cold north winds at night, creating teardrop-shaped crystals. If these crystals remain safe from the sun by staying in shadows or by staying underwater for a day, they will grow into a full Coolark. The head forms first, followed by the rest of the body. Despite being able to inhabit Polsize, Coolarks have never been seen generating there, and existing ones avoid it unless forced.</p>
			<p>At night, Coolarks fly, leaving a trail of small ice crystals and snow. It was once believed these crystals could grow into full Coolarks, but this has been proven false.</p>
			<p>Coolarks have extremely cold bodies, particularly their claws. Prolonged exposure can cause frostbite or even death by freezing. As a result, the inhabitants of Resize feared them, considering them gods of death. This fear persists today, with some still believing they are deities.</p>
			<p>Coolarks do not eat or drink; they simply fly around at night seeking victims. When they find one, they fly around, scratching and pushing against them, causing harm and attempting to freeze them. Due to Coolarks, the inhabitants of Resize live underground and usually stay indoors at night.</p>
			<p>If they find no victims, Coolarks often scratch themselves against cacti, causing small ice bits to fly off their bodies. Some speculate they do this to create ponds where new Coolarks could grow, but this behavior's true purpose is unknown.</p>
			<p>Coolarks are known as one of the most aggressive Leftovers species, posing a significant threat to Resize's inhabitants and giving the region a bad reputation. This notoriety has deterred investment in the country from other regions.</p>
			<p>It is believed that Coolarks were created by the Goddesses as weapons, but their spirits shattered and carried on the planet's winds. Resize is thought to be the only place where these wind-carried fragments meet, forming Coolarks as incomplete versions of a greater weapon creature, often referred to as 'King Coolark'.</p>
