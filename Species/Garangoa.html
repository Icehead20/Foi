            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Garangoas are Civil Divine Ghosts that primarily inhabit the Necrosela region.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are white, round creatures with bright yellow eyes and two smooth limbs at their sides. At their bottom, they have a red oval structure with an elongated yellow curl tail extending from it.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>When a soul, with a morality predominantly leaning towards bad, finds its remains in the Blue Plane will be reborn as a Garangoa. They may or may not retain memories of their past life depending on how successful they were in this process before being attacked and consumed by the Hellsnake.</p>
			<p>They can become ethereal if they actively choose to. In this state, they can pass through inorganic matter but cannot pass through organic matter. They need to concentrate to maintain this state, as their default form is corporeal.</p>
			<p>Like all ghosts, they are affected by and can be destroyed by the power of Soulnaker stones and the energy they produce.</p>
			<p>While in their corporeal state, Garangoas can be damaged and weakened by physical means. If a Garangoa is weakened enough, it can fall into a coma. In this state, a Garangoa becomes completely invisible but not ethereal. Their body will unconsciously float to the valleys of the Necrosela region, where it will remain for an indeterminate amount of time before recovering.</p>
			<p>Garangoas have no need to drink or eat, but they can physically do both. They do not need to breathe or blink. Their only necessity is sleep; a sleep-deprived Garangoa will start to weaken.</p>
			<p>Garangoas do not like the idea of going underwater, a sentiment common to their entire population. They will try to avoid water, as it gives them a sensation similar to electrocution. The reason for this feeling is unknown. They share this aversion with the Souls.</p>
			<p>For a long time, Garangoas were feared and discriminated against for their abilities and morally deviant nature compared to Souls and other Ghosts. However, in recent decades, they have been integrating into society, especially in the First Kingdom.</p>
			<p>They've been known as pranksters and for their deviousness, enough to even be portrayed as such in various fairy tales of the Prime Continent. This behavior has been increasingly punished and discouraged in recent years, with Soulnaker stones and water being used as punishments for crimes committed.</p>
			<p>Since Garangoas have no real needs, they dedicate almost exclusively to leisure and helping people they like. This altruistic nature has led some to try to take advantage of them, prompting recent campaigns aimed at preventing such exploitation.</p>
			<p>They have been criticized for their leisurely demeanor, but they defend themselves by pointing out that they don't need much money due to their lack of necessities. Even if they wanted to earn money, the discrimination against them has limited their job opportunities.</p>
