            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Manayas are Natura Oceans Malerceans that primarily reside in the depths at the heart of the Mareala sea. Occasionally, they are sighted near the borders of Careala and Mareala.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Their upper side features smooth skin adorned with blue spots. Two antennae protrude from their head above their black eyes. Their body resembles a large 'C,' tapering into a small tail. However, their distinguishing trait lies on their undersideâ€”a black mouth brimming with sharp teeth covering the entire lower half.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Known for their peaceful nature, Manayas traverse the territories near deep sea pits, patiently awaiting and seeking food.</p>
			<p>Utilizing their antennae, Manayas possess the ability to sense water currents and detect movements in their vicinity. When sensing a threat, they have the instinct to flip upside down, exposing their array of teeth in the direction of the perceived danger.</p>
			<p>They hunt by ejecting acid from the tip of their tail towards their prey, dissolving it for easier digestion. Once the prey is incapacitated, the Manaya consumes it without the need for chewing.</p>
			<p>Manayas form a unique bond with the Hunders, who exhibit an inexplicable attraction to the Manayas' teeth. The Hunders offer substantial amounts of pre-hunted food to the Manayas, then rest near them in a peculiar symbiotic relationship.</p>
			<p>This preference for teeth by the Hunders has led to a selective survival advantage for Manayas with more teeth. Over time, this selective feeding practice has resulted in Manayas possessing an exaggerated number of teeth.</p>
			<p>In contemporary times, the Hunders no longer show discrimination and provide food to all Manayas equally, content with the current abundance of teeth among them.</p>
			<p>Despite possessing acid-spitting capabilities, Manayas rarely use this acid for hunting, as they have grown accustomed to consuming only the food provided by the Hunders. Instead, they reserve the acid for self-defense purposes.</p>
			<p>Their slender physique and the weight of their teeth limit their ability to swim at higher levels, confining them predominantly to the ocean floor.</p>
			<p>Due to the challenges involved in hunting Manayas, their meat holds a premium price, rendering it a delicacy exclusively accessible to the affluent.</p>
