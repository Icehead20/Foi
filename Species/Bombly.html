            <p>Bomblys are Divine Toys that spontaneously appear in herds of Sonroscas. Members of the Bombly species can be found throughout the world.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Bomblys are dark gray, spherical creatures adorned with light gray wings. They possess a small mouth and bright yellow eyes. Their distinguishing feature is a brown 'wick' on the top of their heads</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Bomblys share several characteristics with Sonroscas, leading to initial beliefs that they were a sub-species. However, current classification identifies them as distinct species despite their visual similarities.</p>
			<p>One notable ability of Bomblys is their capacity for self-destruction, generating a small explosion from the inside out. Their wick ignites and burns as the Bombly prepares to explode. Serving as a visual indicator of their impending detonation. This explosion turns the entire body of the Bombly into ashes. Within approximately 40 seconds, the ashes start to gather, and those that successfully reunite will compress and reform into the original Bombly. The extent to which the ashes rejoin directly influences the size of the regenerated Bombly, e.g., if only half of the ashes combine, the resulting Bombly will be half the size.</p>
			<p>Any ashes that fail to rejoin lose their properties and become regular ashes.</p>
			<p>Bomblys' ashes can be prevented from regenerating by washing them away, causing them to lose all of their properties. Alternatively, swiping them away from the rest as the rejoining process occurs or placing a barrier between them can also prevent them from re-forming into the whole Bombly.</p>
			<p>Bomblys spawn spontaneously within Sonroscas herds, with an estimated ratio of one Bombly for every 40 Sonroscas.</p>
			<p>Sonroscas and Blomblys treat each other as members of their own species, showing mutual acceptance. Even more, Bomblys are known to assist in protecting the swarm if it faces any threats.</p>
			<p>Bomblys have no biological needs; they neither eat, drink, sleep, breathe, nor require rest from flying. They can sustain continuous flight indefinitely.</p>
			<p>Conventional means can exterminate Bomblys, except fire, as they automatically explode upon contact with it. Following an explosion, they undergo the standard process of reformation.</p>
			<p>Internally, Bomblys consist entirely of ash, lacking bones or organs. Externally, Bomblys' bodies resemble carbon paper, exhibiting a texture akin to carbon paper for their eyes and the interior of their mouths.</p>
			<p>Similar to Sonroscas, Bomblys actions can be influenced and controlled through flute melodies, they can even be instructed to explote on commant.</p>
			<p>The explosions caused by Bomblys typically inflict minimal damage to the skin of most species, except for UniDivines.</p>
