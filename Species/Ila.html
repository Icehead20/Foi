            <p>Ila are Civil Natura Malormers Quadrias, a rare species found in sparse numbers across the world. In modern times, they are virtually extinct despite their strange cultural significance.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Ilas are bipedal creatures covered in a thin layer of white fur. At the top of their heads, they have a scalp of various colors, most commonly black, white, and blonde. Their eyes are typically black, red, or blue. A unique physical feature of Ilas is their “double skin”, which folds over their limbs, resembling clothing. This skin darkens slightly at the ends of their limbs after the folds occur. Traditionally, they wear a red obi around their stomach.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Ilas are descended from the Kadana species, which originally inhabited the Prime Continent but were wiped out on the Coma. But A small Kadana tribe that migrated to the Zet Continent survived the event, eventually evolving into the Ila species and spreading back to the Prime Continent years after. However, due to their small population size and lack of genetic diversity, Ilas are now on the brink of extinction.</p>
			<p>One of the most well-known figures connected to the Ila species is Olbways, the eternal queen of Politemia. Though she predates the existence of the Ila species, many Ilas consider her a sacred figure. It is traditional for Ila children to be named after tools and to receive such tools from Olbways in a ceremony at the age of six known as the Naming Ceremony.</p>
			<p>Originally, Ilas had toes, but over time, their feet evolved to be rounder, losing this feature. However, rare individuals, most notably Olbways, still retain toes.</p>
			<p>They are oviparous, laying large, hard-shelled eggs after mating. These eggs take between 6 to 9 months to hatch.</p>
			<p>The skin that folds over their limbs has to be clinically removed under certain conditions, such as growth complications or more prominent during childbirth. Because the leg skin can interfere with egg-laying, it is often removed to ease the process. Once lost, this skin does not regenerate, and the darkened color of the limb ends areas fade, blending into the rest of the body.</p>
			<p>Kadanas originally had a red horn, but this trait was lost when they evolved into Ilas. Some theorize that the red obi tradition began as an attempt to preserve this lost red feature. Over time, its original meaning was forgotten, but the tradition remained. Due to the constant pressure and lack of sunlight from wearing the obi, the fur beneath it is darker and thinner than the rest of the body if it doesn’t fall off entirely, this tradition isn’t considered hygienic.</p>
			<p>There are estimated to be only 20 Ilas left across both continents, with most being female. The species is expected to disappear by the end of the century. Despite their rarity, there have been no conservation efforts, as ethical debates over the protection of Civil species have prevented any meaningful action.</p>
			<p>Olbways has mechanically dismissed questions regarding her connection to the Ila species, insisting that Ilas are just another species like any other, even with their cultural relation and constant crying of her part during the naming ceremony of various members. This has made some people and theorists to consider them special in the story of the planet or to even think they’re some class of holy beings.</p>
			<p>Ilas' anthropomorphic bipedal structure gives them an advantage in tool use and mobility, making them ideal for craftsmanship and agile labor. In the past, they were often employed in skilled handcraft and movement-based jobs, it is thought that they being named after tools come from this practice, but due to their increasing rarity, this hiring tradition has largely faded but the tool naming scheme remained.</p>
			<p>Because Ilas are so scattered, they lack a unified culture, aside from their obi tradition and Name Ceremony with Olbways. Typically, Ilas adopt the culture of the regions they inhabit but often stand out due to their unique appearance, especially on the Prime Continent.</p>
			<p>In recent years, the orphanhood rate among Ilas has skyrocketed. Many believe this is due to a lack of medical experience with Ila-specific health conditions, leading to high parental mortality rates. This has further contributed to their decline as a species.</p>
