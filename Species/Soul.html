            <p>Souls are Civil Divine Ghosts that primarily inhabit the Ebri Kingdom, though they can be found across all around the world. </p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Souls are small, limbless, entirely white beings with rounded bodies, pale eyes, and a small mouth. Two short horns sit atop their heads, while a large, hollow, hat-like tail extends from their backs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>When a soul, with a predominantly good morality, finds its remains in the Blue Plane will be reborn as a Soul. They may or may not retain memories of their past life depending on how successful they were in this process before being attacked and consumed by the Hellsnake.</p>
			<p>Souls are generally corporeal by default, allowing them to be touched and interacted with, though they cannot be harmed by conventional means. At will, they can shift into an ethereal state, enabling them to pass through most matter. Like all Ghosts though, they are vulnerable to Soulnaker stones and the energy they emit, which can destroy them.</p>
			<p>Souls are virtually immortal. They do not require food or drink and are incapable of consuming them in most cases. They do, however, experience fatigue and sleep regularly. A Soul can only die through exposure to Soulnaker energy or by choosing to end their own existence. To do so, a Soul will retreat to solitude, enter a deep sleep, and consciously will themselves to vanish, disappearing permanently when no one's looking.</p>
			<p>Souls naturally float around for locomotion, they can gain full control of the hat-like tail, which often just drifts with the wind, and use it as a limb. Objects can be attached to the tail and manipulated as extensions of the body, though this practice is uncommon.</p>
			<p>Souls universally dislike water, describing the sensation of submersion as akin to electrocution. The cause of this aversion is unknown, but it is shared with the Garangoas.</p>
			<p>Unlike most Ghosts, which primarily manifest in the Necrosela region, Souls typically emerge in the central Prime Continent. Their appearance is slower than that of other Ghosts, generally taking two to three months after locating their remains in the Blue Plane.</p>
			<p>Souls are often regarded as trustworthy due to their origin, and they are widely welcomed among other species. They are known for their helpful and kind nature, though some fear the potential danger should a Soul turn to evil, given their special abilities.</p>
			<p>They are sometimes referred to as the “soup of culture” for their ability to adapt seamlessly to different environments and absorb local customs. Many foreigners rely on Souls as guides to traditions, media, and cultural practices in new regions.</p>
			<p>Within the Ebri Kingdom, Souls were granted privileges and spaces suited to their needs, leading to their adoption there over neighboring realms. Today, they are valued members of the society, especially prominent in academic and media professions.</p>
