            <h1 class="title">The Logic</h1>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>The Logic are the sole members of a unique category and branch that share their own name. They are the original creators of the universe and inhabit a separate dimension tied to the universe they created.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>The Logic do not possess a unified appearance; instead, their forms vary drastically between individuals. Most commonly, they appear as tall, bipedal beings with two or more arms and a head positioned above the shoulders. Some individuals display additional features such as tails, spikes, or other protrusions emerging from their bodies or limbs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>There are currently 118 regular members of The Logic in existence, although the theoretical possibility of additional members remains. The group is led by Helium and Hydrogen, who together act as the queens of The Logic.</p>
			<p>All regular members of The Logic are immortal beings that are generated automatically at the moment a universe comes into existence. Each regular member is intrinsically tied to a specific element of the periodic table and is numbered accordingly.</p>
			<p>At the origin of all things, the 118 regular members of The Logic convened to determine the rules of the universe, including its fundamental laws and physical principles. From their own external dimension, they created all other dimensions within the universe they inhabit. The collective decisions made during this process resulted in the first partitions of reality, giving rise to a multiverse composed of multiple variations reflecting different outcomes of their finalized universal rules.</p>
			<p>The dimension inhabited by The Logic is directly tied to their existence and is malleable by their leaders. Its general structure and properties can be freely altered by them, while the individual enclosures belonging to each Logic member may be modified by their respective owners to reflect personal preference and individuality. In most universes, this dimension also contains a “basement” region, which functions as an afterlife or repository for souls.</p>
			<p>During the phase in which the laws of the universe are being established, The Logic are capable of creating additional internal dimensions within their universe, each potentially governed by its own distinct rules. However, during this process, there are two aspects beyond their control: the existence of The Logic members themselves and the existence of souls. Once the laws of the universe are finalized, their influence over it decreases drastically.</p>
			<p>In addition to the regular members, a non-regular The Logic entity is automatically created at the beginning of each universe. This being represents the consciousness of the universe itself and is known as “The Table” or “The Universe”. The Table is omnipotent within itself, possessing power far exceeding that of the regular Logic members. It can alter its form at will but always manifests with a pair of scissors, which serve as the instrument through which its powers are exercised.</p>
			<p>The Table is the most powerful entity in existence, capable of traveling across multiple universes and even destroying itself to create a new universe at will. However, its powers are significantly reduced when operating outside its native universe, rendering it incapable of destroying foreign universes. The Table typically does not participate in the decision-making of the regular The Logic members, and they are generally unaware of its existence. If the Table loses its scissors, it loses its powers entirely. Should the Table die, the universe continues to exist as a “corpse”, gradually succumbing to entropy without any means of alteration or renewal. The Table usually does not reside within the same dimension as the regular The Logic members.</p>
			<p>Regular Logic members associated with higher atomic numbers often exhibit traits of degeneracy and mental instability, particularly those tied to radioactive elements. These higher-numbered members also tend to possess greater physical mass.</p>
			<p>The physical appearance of each Logic member reflects the element to which they are bound, frequently incorporating protrusions or externalized features reminiscent of that element. In rare cases, a single Logic individual may contain multiple consciousnesses. While their personalities, height, coloration, and mental maturity vary widely, all regular Logic members are invariably female.</p>
			<p>Regular Logic members are capable of manifesting outside their native dimension, though such occurrences are exceedingly rare. When they do occur, their presence is never acknowledged or remembered by those who witness it.</p>
			<p>Regular Logic members possess “contextual properties” when interacting with one another. When two members make contact, their interaction mirrors the chemical reaction that would occur between their respective elements. However, the outcome of such interactions can be influenced by situational context, intent, and external factors shaping the overall zeitgeist. As a result, reactions may vary, producing different outcomes analogous to alternative chemical combinations, such as H and O forming H₂O, H₂ and O, or other configurations.</p>
