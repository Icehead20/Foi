            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Thunderhuds are Natura Oceans Finers that form sizable electric banks, migrating through the waters of Mareala.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Thunderhuds are small slim creatures with yellow semi-transparent skin, revealing the black organs within. Their fins are characterized by a pointed and slightly elongated structure. They have black eyes and a moon-shaped tail.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Thunderhuds group in large banks and migrate to warmer waters when their current habitat begins to cool in winter. They primarily feed on LimaWeed and algae from expansive banks deep in the sea.</p>
			<p>Thunderhuds are highly communal creatures, it's uncommon to observe individuals straying from their banks.</p>
			<p>Thunderhud banks typically consist of three or more family groups. During mating season, these distinct families come together to ensure genetic diversity within the Thunderhud population.</p>
			<p>The eggs of Thunderhuds boast one of the strongest shells in the marine world. These resilient eggs are stored in a special pocket within their parents' mouths until the hatching period.</p>
			<p>They possess black organs that generate electricity, Thunderhuds channel this energy through their fins, emitting rays that often extend towards neighboring Thunderhuds. In banks, this creates a perilous environment for those lacking adequate electric protection.</p>
			<p>Before releasing an electric discharge, their black organs vibrate, their bodies illuminate in a white glow, and the discharge is unleashed through their fins. This discharge may either hit other species or the open sea. However, if another Thunderhud is nearby, the discharge is likely to be channeled toward them.</p>
			<p>When a Thunderhud is struck by an electric charge, the excess energy beyond its capacity is immediately released into the void or is directed toward another Thunderhud.</p>
			<p>Despite their electrifying defense, Thunderhuds face threats from resisten predators such as Fategas and Balleys. Thunderhud are drawn to the LimaWeed on Balleys' backs like bait, which the Balleys use in their advantage to consume large amounts of Thunderhuds.</p>
			<p>Their tendency to electrocute any approaching creatures, have instilled a learned behavior in most species to steer clear of Thunderhud banks.</p>
			<p>Thunderhud meat common in the Zet Continent and the Carala Region, although their fishing can be quite challenging.</p>
