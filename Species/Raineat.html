            <p>Raineat are Divine Leftovers that originate in the clouds and can be encounter all around The Prime Kingdom.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They appear as long, flat, multicolored rainbows with two black eyes and a white jaw at one of their ends.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Raineats do not reproduce conventionally; they spawn in clouds under specific conditions. They require ample sunlight, intense heat, and a large water mass capable of reflecting an entire cloud. When these conditions align, a Raineat emerges from the reflected cloud, one end tethered to the cloud while the other bears its eye and jaw.</p>
			<p>Once born, a Raineat cannot detach from its cloud. If its cloud is entirely destroyed, the Raineat vanishes along with it.</p>
			<p>There is no limit to the length of a Raineat's body; it can extend indefinitely if the Raineat need to.</p>
			<p>While they are most commonly sighted in the Prime Continent, they cannot naturally spawn there due to unsuitable conditions. Those found in the region often originate from the sea, carried by natural airflows to the Prime Continent along with their clouds.</p>
			<p>Encounters with Raineats in The Zet Continent are exceedingly rare.</p>
			<p>Raineats can be harmed by conventional means; their bodies offer no resistance and can be easily cut. Excessive harm leads to the Raineat's demise and complete disappearance.</p>
			<p>When a Raineat is vanish, they leave nothing behind, even their jaw and eyes dissapear completly.</p>
			<p>These entities are most visible between March and September, being less frequent in other months.</p>
			<p>By nature, Raineats tend to be aggressive, resembling angry Birds. They attack vigorously, emitting screams and dive-bombing their targets from high altitudes. Their primary attack involves tackling victims from above, seizing them with their jaws and biting them.</p>
			<p>Between attacks, they navigate the skies, twisting and resting upon their clouds.</p>
			<p>Raineats do not consume anything; they solely absorb sunlight through their bodies.</p>
			<p>While it is theoretically possible to tame a Raineat with time and training, very few have succeeded. Taming is not recommended due to their inherently violent nature, which can resurface unexpectedly.</p>
			<p>Typically, the First Kingdom army handles the extermination of Raineats that pose threats to the safety of the Prime Continent.</p>
			<p>Despite their similarities, Raibotears are not related to Raineats. A Raineat can't gave birth to a Raibotear. Even more, if left alone without intervention, both species may exhibit aggressive tendencies toward each other.</p>
