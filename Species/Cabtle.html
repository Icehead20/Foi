            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Cabtle are Natura Malormes Cattlefour native to the plains of the Prime Continent. They are primarily used by various Civil species for transportation.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Cabtle are large, elongated quadrupeds covered in yellow fur. They have long necks and small heads with short snouts. A large and prominent mane, usually brown but sometimes in other colors, adorns their necks. They have black hooves, black eyes, small ears, and nostrils, as well as tails emerging from a blue base.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Cabtle evolved from Fluffail on the Zet Continent, migrating to the Prime Continent where the lack of competition, predators, and different climate led to the loss of their horns and thicker skin, making them lighter and more docile. These more docile variants were domesticated and widely used for transporting people and materials over long distances.</p>
			<p>Cabtle primarily feed on grass and vegetables, with the plants and herbs from The Politemia being the most nutritious for them. Consequently, groups of Cabtle are often seen within and around The Politemia.</p>
			<p>The blue gland on their back emits a gas that irritates Sonroscas and other Mutibugs, preventing these pests from approaching and reducing the risk of sickness from bug bites. This gas also has a distinctive smell that other Cabtle can recognize and follow if they become separated from their group.</p>
			<p>A Cabtle's blue gland can be extracted and historically has been used to make repellents. The gland is liquefied, and the resulting liquid is used to cover areas needing protection. However, this method only remains effective for a few days and negatively affects the health of the Cabtle from which the gland was extracted.</p>
			<p>Cabtle are born with their full coat of fur, which does not grow further as they age. When they reach old age, their fur begins to fall out. If a Cabtle is trimmed, its fur will not regrow, making it vulnerable to cold temperatures.</p>
			<p>With the advent of more efficient transportation methods, Cabtle have become less common as a primary mode of transport, now primarily appearing in carnivals and children's entertainment.</p>
			<p>Cabtle meat is consumable, and they were once hunted nearly to extinction. However, hunting was eventually prohibited, and conservation efforts were implemented, though these efforts are now being neglected.</p>
			<p>The decline in the use of Cabtle for transportation has led to an increase in wild Cabtle populations in the Acela region, prompting some to resume hunting them.</p>
			<p>Cabtle's genetic structure is highly adaptable, suggesting potential for modification. The concept of creating a 'Superior Cabtle' through DNA modification has been proposed, but these plans have been indefinitely postponed.</p>
