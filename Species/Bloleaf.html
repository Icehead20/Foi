            <p>The Bloleaf are Natura Mutibugs Armer that reside in the depths of the Verdosola forests.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Roughly the size of a baby shoe, they feature a leaf-like structure covering their entire back, excluding the area around their eyes wich is more similar to a flower. Their elongated heads sport a yellow trunk with four teeth at its base. With a segmented yellow body, they possess four lower legs and two upper extremities that culminate in tweezers with pink details.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Bloleafs adopt a motionless stance, blending seamlessly with their surroundings, until another creature approaches. Upon sensing proximity, they lunge at the target, piercing it with their trunk and clamping their teeth tight into it's skin to then feed on its blood. They keep clinging on their prey sucking the blood until the prey either breaks free, succumbs, or the Bloleaf becomes satiated.</p>
			<p>Their tweezers can serve both as grasping tools for securing prey and as defensive weapons if threatened as well as other functions.</p>
			<p>Bloleafs have been observed using their tweezers to carefully cut leaves from bushes and various plants, assuming the place of the removed leaf. This additional camouflage allows them to further blend seamlessly into their surroundings.</p>
			<p>They primarily target small Mutibugs such as Sonroscas and bigger Malormes that pass by but they refrain from attacking their own species.</p>
			<p>Should they encounter an entity without blood, impervious to their piercing, or after feeding, Bloleafs retreat to a safe location to restart their hunting routine.</p>
			<p>Female Bloleafs deposit unfertilized eggs underground near the base and roots of plants. These eggs emit a distinct scent recognizable by male Bloleafs. Upon discovery, a male excavates and fertilizes these eggs before reburial. Approximately a week later, the newborn Bloleafs emerge from the ground to the surface.</p>
