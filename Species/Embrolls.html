            <p>The Embrolls are Civil Natura Malormes Ballus that once inhabited the Verdosola region, but are now on the brink of extinction.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Embrolls are characterized by their large, limbless, head-like bodies, which are predominantly yellow in color. They possess five red eyes of diferent sizes, each with blue triangular glands beneath them. Additionally, they have brown hair, with a blue gland located at the back from which a tissue resembling hair emerges, but in reality, is their umbilical cord.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>All of their eyes move synchronously; they cannot look in different directions independently. The lower right eye appears to be partially blind, while the central eye, positioned above all the others, is considered the 'main' eye and has the best eyesight among them.</p>
			<p>Despite their immense size and weight, Embrolls move swiftly by jumping, causing the ground beneath them to tremble. Their robust skin and bones, coupled with their large brain, contribute to their considerable mass, making them one of the largest and heaviest Civil species. However, their sturdy structure ensures that their brain and insides remains unaffected by the violent vibrations caused by their movements.</p>
			<p>The umbilical cord of Embrolls is situated on their backs and is naturally halved during birth but not entirely removed. Instead, it is quickly sutured after birth and remains in place as a pseudo ponytail. While it can be removed without causing harm to the Embrolls, they typically choose to retain it as part of their cultural tradition.</p>
			<p>The blue glands of Embrolls feature a complex structure of muscle and tissue that generates vibrations corresponding to the emotions of the Embrolls. These structures, which are highly resilient, act as "bumpers" during physical confrontations, offering protection against damage in fights in the wild. This unique adaptation contributes to making Embrolls one of the most resilient species in the Civil realm, often outlasting opponents in battles due to their exceptional durability.</p>
			<p>Embrolls are omnivores, requiring a substantial amount of food to sustain themselves. Interestingly, they prefer consuming a large portion of food all at once rather than smaller portions, often rejecting smaller servings.</p>
			<p>Embrolls, one of the earliest members of the Ballus, trace their origins back to the Magma Age, back then they had to fight the large creatures and predators that inhabiting the ancient Prime Continent to survive. They lived in tribes within the Verdosola region, Embrolls organized their communities around a towering structure that served as the home of their leader. These leaders played a crusial role in organizing the tribe and devising intricate strategies for hunting prey and gathering food to sustain their communities.</p>
			<p>One of the few remnants of their civilization is Chess. The event know as the Coma wipped nearly all of their population and civilization and reshaped the landscape of the Prime Continent. Only the lineage of the Chess Kingdom's Queen, Prissne, endured the devastation, and she stands today as the sole surviving member of the species.</p>
			<p>The events of the Coma and the passage of time have obscured much of Embrolls' origins and civilization, shrouding them in mystery for modern historians. Althought some traces of their old civilization can still be seen in the current Chess Kingdom.</p>
