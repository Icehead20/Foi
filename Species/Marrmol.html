            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Marrmols are Natura Malormes Materlas that inhabit in the forests of the Verdosola region and its environs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Marrmol are large quadrupedal creatures covered in brown fur, which conceals their eyes beneath a prominent forehead. They have two large, curved yellow tusks and a large mouth hidden by their beard-like fur. Their torso is disk-shaped, supporting four bent legs that end in black paws. A distinctive feature of Marrmol is the prominent tree that often grows on their backs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>The Marrmol's torso functions almost independently from the rest of its body, acting like a rotating disk. This design allows them to move by manipulating their legs up and down while rotating their torso to move in specific directions. The upper and lower parts of their bodies can rotate independently, either in the same or opposite directions.</p>
			<p>Dubbed 'The Ballet of the Earth' due to their size and the unique flora growing on their backs, Marrmols are culturally seen as majestic creatures and have been revered by various cultures throughout history.</p>
			<p>During pregnancy, the fetus is harbored beneath a tree on the Marrmol's back, known as the 'Fundamental Tree'. Toward the end of gestation, this tree implants a seed into the Marrmol's back. The Fundamental Tree grows along with the Marrmol, often reaching immense sizes. However, this relationship is parasitic, with the tree drawing energy from its host, forcing the Marrmol to consume more than double the usual amount of food to survive.</p>
			<p>The tree cannot be removed without causing brain death to the Marrmol, as its primitive roots are connected to the host's brain. As long as these roots remain, the tree can regenerate if partially cut.</p>
			<p>The origin of their Fundamental Tree and its parasitic relationship with Marrmols is unknown. This type of tree only exists with Marrmols and is not found anywhere else in the wild. Historical records always depict Marrmols with this tree. Some theories suggest that the special fecal matter of one of their ancestors, the Scatosmell, may have contributed to the development of this relationship.</p>
			<p>Marrmols use their tusks to spin and topple trees, consuming the leaves. They can also use this method to attack when threatened or stressed. Despite their colossal size, Marrmols are generally passive and gentle unless provoked. Their size, however, can pose accidental dangers to those around them, as they might inadvertently step on or strike someone with their tusks.</p>
			<p>Marrmols gather in clearings within their forest habitat, leaving identifiable paths devoid of large vegetation. They are communal and travel in family groups that help each other but do not necessarily merge with other families unless in dire situations.</p>
			<p>Their population remains low due to historical hunting for their valuable fur and tusks. Currently, hunting Marrmols and possessing their tusks is illegal in various kingdoms surrounding their habitat. Organizations exist to protect them and ensure their safety.</p>
