            <p>Balley are Natura Oceans Malerceans that inhabit the Mareala ocean between The Zet Continent and The Prime Continent.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They boast an immense size, characterized by large white eyes, fins, and six blowholes at the end of their head three in each side of it. On their backs, an abundance of green seaweed typically thrives.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>They travel through the Mareala seas, tracking the flocks of Thunderhuds they primarily feed on, when they're not eating Thunderhud they consume Bianton and other microorganisms encountered during their travels.</p>
			<p>Periodically, they surface to breathe and rest. During these moments, only their upper halves are visible, often mistaken for small islands.</p>
			<p>Balleys journey in family-based groups, often joining with other family clusters to form larger assemblies. While maintaining a respectful distance between families, they exhibit non-aggressive behavior towards one another.</p>
			<p>Their feeding peaks before winter, coinciding with the highest concentration of Thunderhud in Mareala's waters. Following this, they migrate to waters closer to the Prime continent for reproduction, seeking fewer predators but less food. Post-reproduction, they migrate back toward the Zet continent.</p>
			<p>LimaWeed thrives and spreads across the thick backs of the Balleys, sustained by layers of grease stored on their backs.</p>
			<p>Wherever Balleys venture, they propagate LimaWeed, often transmitting it to newborns at birth. LimaWeed that fall by the side often get to thrive on deceased organic matter on the ocean floor, growing and eventually becoming sustenance for Thunderhud and various other species.</p>
			<p>Remarkably, the entirety of a Balley's body is resistant to the Thunderhud's electricity, especially their inner systems and the baleen of their mouths which work as a barrier of small electric rods that dissipate the more powerful discharges. They stand as the sole creatures capable of withstanding such electrical charges at this level.</p>
			<p>At times, Balleys stray from their intended path, wandering towards the seas near Reverse Island and Masaland. When this occurs, these wandering individuals become a spectacle for onlookers. However, these lost Balleys often fail to reunite with their kin and eventually perish alone. Recent efforts have emerged to aid these lost Balleys, guiding them back to their rightful habitats.</p>
