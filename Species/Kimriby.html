            <p>Kimriby are Civil Artificial Eslabians, manufactured in the ancient robot factory of Eslawba. They are scarce but can be found in small quantities all over the world.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They have a metallic round body made of a slightly moldable material, with two large black eyes and several screws around their sides. On top of their body, there is a hole from which a large orange spike protrudes.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>When the robot factory of Eslawba was discovered, one of the first experiments conducted was the creation of Kimriby models. They were designed to serve as guards and police in various regions and kingdoms, representing the First Kingdom and ensuring everything ran smoothly.</p>
			<p>Due to early challenges on robot designing, particularly with creating functional legs, Kimribys lack these limbs and instead have to move by hopping around. They lack arms for similar design reasons as their lack of legs.</p>
			<p>They can extend and maneuver the spike on their head like a lance or spear, even bending and twisting it to use like an arm, although it lacks fingers and is less effective than a real arm.</p>
			<p>Kimribys generally have aggressive personalities but usually do not cause harm. They tend to be verbally aggressive and use intimidation. However, if they are attacked or surprised, they will respond with violence, which has led to numerous accidents in the past.</p>
			<p>A design flaw left all Kimribys colorblind, a mistake not discovered until years after their creation. Kimribys assumed everyone saw things the way they did and never mentioned their inability to see color.</p>
			<p>Kimribys weren't programmed with any specific gender. Instead, they tend to adopt characteristics of the people around them, often resulting in a mix of various demeanors and traits. Kimribys can be seen as any given gender, both, or none at any given time.</p>
			<p>The Kimriby model was eventually discontinued, leading to their scarcity. The remaining Kimribys spread across the Prime Continent, with a few on the Zet Continent. Giroduos replaced most Kimribys as guards, and many Kimribys shifted to work as hired guards for those who could afford their services. Some remain in the First Kingdom army but harbor resentment towards Giroduos.</p>
			<p>Officially, the switch from Kimribys to Giroduos was due to technological advancements that made Giroduos more efficient. However, it is believed that the change was also influenced by concerns over Kimribys' aggressiveness and perceived unreliability.</p>
			<p>Prejudices against Kimribys remain mostly within the First Kingdom and its surrounding areas. Consequently, they have found more acceptance in other kingdoms. In Euwa, they are valued for their work in construction, and in the Ice Kingdom, they are known for their sculpting abilities.</p>
