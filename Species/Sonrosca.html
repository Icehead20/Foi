            <p>Sonroscas are Natura Mutibugs Aero that inhabit areas abundant in food and warm temperatures in both continents.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They're minute creatures, characterized by a small, round black body and a pair of grey wings at their sides. They lack eyes but possess a prominent row of yellowish teeth.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Sonroscas are possess a robust jaws and sturdy teeth, allowing them to tear off sizable portions of fruits, meat, etc.</p>
			<p>Their cheeks have the ability to expand, serving as storage for food either for themselves or for other Sonroscas.</p>
			<p>Sonroscas possess a broad diet, capable of consuming almost any organic matter. While they can eat plant leaves, these lack sufficient nutrients. They prefer other organic sources such as meat and even excrement for their sustenance.</p>
			<p>Sonroscas soar in massive swarms, and when two swarms encounter each other, they often merge. These amalgamated swarms typically find refuge inside trees or small enclosed warm spaces. While the majority of the swarm takes a rest, certain "scout" Sonroscas are dispatched to locate food. Once they pinpoint a food source, these scouts communicate its position to the entire swarm.</p>
			<p>Blomblys are commonly found in swarms of Sonroscas, with an approximate ratio of 1 Blombly per 40 Sonroscas.</p>
			<p>Sonroscas and Blomblys treat each other as members of their own species, showing mutual acceptance. Even more, Bomblys are known to assist in protecting the swarm if it faces any threats.</p>
			<p>Originating from their prehistoric giant ancestors, Sonroscas adapted to the different environmental conditions on the Zet Continent, eventually supplanting the giants after their extinction and returning to dominance all over the world.</p>
			<p>Communication among Sonroscas involves the clashing of their teeth and specific noises that convey various messages, such as indicating the presence of food or signaling danger.</p>
			<p>Sonroscas typically have a lifespan of about a week, mating around the midpoint of their lives. Eggs are never laid externally; they are fertilized inside the Sonrosca and remain within until its death. Afterward, the eggs hatch inside the deceased Sonrosca, and the newborns consume their way out of the parent, utilizing it for sustenance.</p>
			<p>Sonroscas are drawn to flute melodies, a behavioral trait inherited from their prehistoric predecessors, making them susceptible to being controlled through these tunes, influencing their actions.</p>
			<p>In the gastronomy of Polzise and in the general culture of the Dracandreas, Sonroscas hold a notable place.</p>
