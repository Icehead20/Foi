            <p>White Yarks are Natura Oceans Finers that inhabit coral reefs in the open seas. They are a more evolved subspecies of the regular Yark.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>White Yarks are medium-sized, elongated, angular pale-white creatures distinguished by a large, pointed dorsal fin and a body that tapers into a sharp, half-moon-shaped tail. Their skin is rough, and they possess two small pointed side fins. Their sharp mouths are lined with pointed teeth, and they have large black eyes with white pupils. These eyes are partially shielded by protective strips of tissue resembling bars, positioned near their triangular gills.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>White Yarks are a rare species that diverged from regular Yarks. They evolved to mimic more typical Finer species, developing side fins that grant them greater precision in movement. Their skin became rougher and more angular, and their coloration shifted to pale white to blend with the rocky environments they inhabit.</p>
			<p>They hunt by stealthily trailing their prey with slow, controlled undulating motions. When close enough, they bite and seize the target, using their teeth to hook their prey, preventing them from escaping. They then clamp their jaws shut with great force until the prey stops moving. Once immobilized, the prey remains lodged in their teeth until the Yark returns to its hideout to feed.</p>
			<p>White Yarks create their hideouts in small underground holes, sometimes excavating them on their own. They typically block the entrance with their bodies, leaving their loin and dorsal fin outside while keeping their head and tail inside the cavity.</p>
			<p>Their skin is thick, rough, and durable, providing essential protection for their otherwise fragile internal organs. This includes their eyes, shielded by skin strips reminiscent of jail bars. Only the skin around the dorsal fin—and the fin itself—is less resilient; it is common for White Yarks to lose small portions of this fin over time.</p>
			<p>White Yarks have more oval-shaped eyes compared to regular Yarks, better suited to their hunting style. However, they lack the pupil-morphing abilities and broader visual adaptability of their relatives.</p>
			<p>Their spike-shaped gills help filter debris when digging their hideouts and maintain a water connection between the interior and exterior, ensuring proper circulation. These gills also help protect against parasites and infections by producing a defensive substance.</p>
			<p>The reason for the evolution of this branch of Yarks remains unknown. Although White Yarks appear to be a more efficient variation of the regular Yark, there is no clear evolutionary pressure that would have required such adaptations. Some theories propose a random mutation, descent from Albino Yarks that survived by resembling rocks, or interspecies mating. It is believed that if they were more abundant and reproduced faster, they might outcompete regular Yarks. However, they remain a rare species with limited numbers in the wild.</p>
			<p>White Yarks and regular Yarks generally ignore each other in the wild, and forced interactions create stress in both species. They typically attempt to turn away and separate as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>After mating, female White Yarks enter an intensive hunting spree, gathering as much food as possible before retreating into their hideout to lay eggs. They remain inside until the eggs hatch, surviving solely on the food collected beforehand. Hatchlings are initially small and round—resembling regular Yarks—but become longer and more angular as they grow. While confined to the hole, their growth is minimal; they only begin growing toward full size once they venture out to hunt independently. Unlike regular Yarks, White Yarks have a fixed growth and age limit of around 35 years.</p>
			<p>White Yarks only achieve full sleep during youth. Upon maturity, they shift to a continuous partial-rest cycle, where small regions of the brain rest one at a time, keeping them always active. This process halts only under extreme circumstances, allowing full cognitive activation during emergencies.</p>
			<p>White Yarks are solitary creatures, interacting with others solely during mating season, except for relationships between parents and offspring. A parent White Yark assists its young in hunting until they reach full size, after which they separate. Even years later, White Yarks can recognize family members and may assist them when needed.</p>
			<p>White Yark meat is generally considered poor in taste and very dry. Nevertheless, they are hunted and treated as a delicacy due to their rarity. Illegal hunting for their meat and for the exotic pet trade has caused a significant population decline. They cannot breed in captivity, prompting legal protections for the species. Despite these efforts, they remain among the most heavily trafficked species in the world.</p>
