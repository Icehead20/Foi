            <p>Puclear are Artificial Viscos that originate in the Necrosela region. They are strange creatures of mysterious origin.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They're small, green, and slimy creatures with a shell resembling a metal bucket. They emit a dim green light from their bodies, except for their hollow eyes, which reveal their black interiors.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>The classification of Puclear is still debated. Some believe they are natural creatures native to Eslawba, while others think they are Artificial, a classification they currently hold. The latter theory stems from their initial appearance coinciding with the start of operations at the Eslawba robot factory. It is speculated that they are byproducts of the factory's robot production, discarded through its pipes. Another theory suggests that Puclears are cross-dimensional quantum beings attracted to the energy produced by the robot factory. Some even consider them divine beings from the Goddess Rad, due to their similar properties, though mythology does not support this claim. Their true origin remains unknown to this day.</p>
			<p>Puclears emit radioactivity, which complicated their study for a long time before proper methods were invented. This radiation does not have long-term environmental effects and vanishes completely in some minutes, but the harm they produced during that time remains. Their dim green light makes them easily visible at night, prompting most creatures to avoid them to avoid radiation exposure.</p>
			<p>They are only visible at night, appearing when the sun sets and no one is looking. They wander slowly through the fields of Necrosela, staying close to Eslawba, and do not react to their surroundings, even if kicked or slammed.</p>
			<p>They don't seem to have any needs or thoughts. They cannot consume any material, and liquids are completely repelled by their bodies. Some theorize, however, that they consume darkness itself.</p>
			<p>During the day, Puclears vanish with the sunrise, but only if unobserved. If continuously watched, they remain visible, wandering randomly until it gets out of sight.</p>
			<p>Their slimy bodies are completely impenetrable by earthly means. Objects inserted through their hollow eyes remain inside them. When Puclears disappear during the day, the objects vanish with them and reappear the next night with the Puclear only 50% of the time for unknown reasons.</p>
			<p>The Puclear population remains relatively consistent over the years. It is believed that the first Puclears ever seen are the same individuals observed today. Initially, it was thought that when they disappeared, they died, and the ones seen the next night were different Puclears. However, experiments involving inserting objects into their eyes have proven that they are the same individuals, disappearing and reappearing each night in different locations.</p>
			<p>It is theorized that their radiation contributes to the barrenness and infertility of the Necrosela region. Efforts to combat this involve pushing Puclears into holes or designated areas. However, since they do not reappear in the same locations, long-term containment is difficult without constant vigilance.</p>
			<p>Although Puclears appear to lack a physical form, they have mass, weight, and some sort of energy. Their interiors contain compressed quarks floating within their slimy green bodies.</p>
