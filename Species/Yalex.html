            <p>Yalex are Natura Oceans Molusle that have inhabited the underwater caves and ravines deep in the Mareala Sea since ancient times.</p>

            <p>These small, round blue creatures have 13 tiny tentacle limbs and large black eyes with white pupils. They are also characterized by a large, curved yellow shell attached to their bodies.</p>

            <p>Yalex are ancient creatures from the Magma Age, among the first marine creatures to exist. They were once abundant and dominated the Mareala Seas during their prime.</p>
			<p>Yalex sustained themselves by scavenging minerals from the seafloor but could also absorb biomass through their skin. They found minerals and biomass falling from the surface especially nutritious. Their slow metabolism and rapid reproduction contributed to their past success.</p>
			<p>These slow-moving creatures have low reflexes and typically conserve energy. However, they have a strong grip, and if multiple Yalex grab a creature at once, they can drag it underwater to drown and consume it. Therefore, it's advisable to avoid large groups of Yalex if possible.</p>
			<p>During the Magma Age, they had two natural predators: Antrialex, which camouflaged as Yalex and ate them, and Bignet, which stayed on the surface and used its long neck to swallow them whole. These predators helped control the Yalex population, though they remained overabundant.</p>
			<p>Yalex are communal and care for each other. They can spit a nutrient-rich substance containing all necessary minerals, which other Yalex can consume for energy when needed.</p>
			<p>Their vital organs are housed in their shells, which act more like an external skull than a protective shell, as they cannot hide inside them. These durable shells can last for decades after the Yalex dies.</p>
			<p>The transition from the Magma Age to the Coma brought extinction events and environmental changes that drastically reduced Yalex numbers, clearing the seas and allowing space for other marine species to emerge. The new environment was unfavorable for Yalex, and the few survivors retreated to the deepest parts of the sea.</p>
			<p>In the modern era, Yalex have become more active, and their numbers have grown, but they remain rare and are weaker compared to modern marine species. They rely more on consuming minerals from the ground and whatever biomass they can find.</p>
			<p>Though they do not have good taste, their rarity makes them a status symbol among the wealthy. The shells and fossils of Magma Age Yalex fetch high prices and are highly valued for historical analysis due to Yalexâ€™s biology being mostly unchanged over hundreds of years from the Magma Age to the present day.</p>
