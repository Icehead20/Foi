            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Zebrelle are Natura Oceans Finers that inhabit the open sea, where they search and hunt for prey.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Zebrelles are medium-sized, elongated creatures, their bodies are white with black stripes, and they have a distinctive yellow fin on top of their head, as well as two yellow fins at the tip of their tail. Their eyes are completely white, and their mouths are filled with sharp teeth, constantly secreting a red liquid.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Zebrelles are among the most feared and violent predators of the sea, possessing high resistance to poison. Their sharp teeth can pierce through defenses like shells, making them nearly unstoppable against other species' natural defenses, with the exception of Thunderhud's electrical attacks.</p>
			<p>They typically wander coral reefs and areas with dense vegetation, where prey is abundant. Zebrelles are not picky eaters; they will consume anything they encounter, including members of their own species and humans.</p>
			<p>Zebrelles are fast swimmers and physically strong, but they need to eat constantly to maintain their strength. If they don't consume food every 10 minutes, their stomach acid will eventually kill them. This constant need for food prevents them from sleeping.</p>
			<p>Their unique coloration provides both camouflage and intimidation. The black and white stripes help them blend into the underwater environment, while the bright yellow fins are believed to play a role in mating displays and confusing prey during hunts.</p>
			<p>Zebrelles secrete a red blood-like substance from their mouths, composed of hormones and excrement. These special hormones make the Zebrelle more violent and stronger, while attracting other creatures with its sweet and addictive flavor. This substance helps lure prey directly into the Zebrelle's mouth.</p>
			<p>The organ in their mouth that produces this red substance is called the "Raber." Recently, it has been discovered that Raber can be used in medicine to treat tumors and other conditions. However, due to the difficulty of breeding and handling Zebrelles, the use of Raber is not as widespread as it could be.</p>
			<p>Zebrelles reproduce through external fertilization. During mating season, females release eggs into the water, which males then fertilize. The eggs are left to develop and hatch on their own, with no parental care. Young Zebrelles are vulnerable and often fall prey to other sea creatures until they grow large enough to defend themselves and their Raber develop.</p>
			<p>Their teeth regrow over time, and Zebrelle teeth in good condition can be highly valuable on the Polsize market. In Spain, their skin was once used in high-profile fashion items before an extermination campaign reduced their numbers near Spanish coasts, following an attack on the Queen.</p>
			<p>It is believed that Zebrelles were not always as aggressive as they are now. They may have mutated due to sea pollution, which enabled them to develop the Raber organ with the help of absorbed pollutants. Zebrelles born in captivity outside the sea are less aggressive than their wild counterparts.</p>
			<p>There have been reports of Zebrelles attacking larger predators like Bigmauchs and even the Beasts of the Sea. As a result, they are often portrayed in popular culture as forces of destruction and among the most evil and dangerous creatures of the sea.</p>
