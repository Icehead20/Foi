            <p>N.M.S. are Natura CosiPlants N/A and can be found throughout both continents, thriving in locations that meet their essential growth conditions.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are small yellow creatures with lengthy leaves terminating in spiny tips. Positioned near the center of their base they have two black spots resembling eyes, while small brown roots extend below them.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>N.M.S. typically thrive primarily in damp, compact environments, preferably with soft terrain, and are often observed in abandoned locations.</p>
			<p>They draw nutrients from their surroundings and harness sunlight for sustenance until they reach maturity. At this stage, they undergo a process of expending all their energy to release a substantial amount of spores. Following this release, they descend and enter a semi-dormant state for a period before eventually perishing.</p>
			<p>Despite their growth and reproductive functions, N.M.S. exhibit minimal complexity. They possess limited leaf movement, minimal consciousness, and are incapable of experiencing pain or emotions. Their primary activities revolve around reproduction and growth.</p>
			<p>During reproduction, N.M.S. emit approximately 1 to 2 thousand spores, with a majority failing to germinate. The size of an N.M.S. is directly influenced by the availability of nutrients and sunlight in the terrein they end up germinating in.</p>
			<p>While adaptable to various terrains, N.M.S. are commonly found in neglected areas, contributing to their association with abandoned places. The spiny tips and black spots on their structure serve as defensive mechanisms. Additionally, their "eyes" are believed to create an illusion of being watched, inducing unease in potential predators and discouraging them.</p>
			<p>N.M.S. release a liquid akin to sweat, a waste byproduct exuded in liquid form from their leaves.</p>
			<p>N.M.S.'s sweat was utilized as a lubricant in ancient times but has fallen out of favor in recent times.</p>
			<p>Infestations of N.M.S. have occurred in towns with suitable conditions. In response, N.M.S. fumigator associations have been established to eradicate these infestations. These organizations also focus on eliminating N.M.S. in abandoned structures that are slated for remodeling.</p>
