            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Afilides are Civil Artificial Eslabians and are one of the main populations of the Chess Kingdom.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Afilides are entirely white robots, resembling Ilas in shape. They have four black segmented legs at their base and a large crown-like structure with a cross on top of their small head. They possess two arms, with hands that end in cannons capable of shooting black boulders.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Afilides hold the third highest rank in the Chess Kingdom, just below the Queen, Prinssne, and her assistant, Tower. This places them above Toweniors and Peons.</p>
			<p>Afilides specialize in long-range attacks, shooting black metal boulders. They also have a variation of these boulders connected to ropes, which they can use as hookshots. When these penetrate an enemy, they can manipulate the enemy's movements or combine with other Afilides to create a net, immobilizing the target.</p>
			<p>Their legs are an early prototype of the advanced robotic legs later used in Mekafields, which are considered the best robotic leg design. Newer Afilides models retain the look of the original legs for consistency while incorporating the improved design.</p>
			<p>The boulders they shoot are magnetic, allowing Afilides to control and move metal objects to some extent. This ability is less effective than using actual hands and only works with metals. Consequently, many items in the Chess Kingdom have metal components to facilitate use by Afilides.</p>
			<p>Afilides are generally proud, authoritarian, and tsundere, making them difficult to socialize with despite their good intentions. However, forming a good relationship with an Afilides can result in a loyal ally and friend.</p>
			<p>They possess large memory capacities, fast reactions, and attention to detail, thanks to the components and extra RAM housed in their 'crown'. However, this comes with the downside that damage to this part can cause them to freeze or malfunction.</p>
			<p>Afilides are rarely seen outside the Chess Kingdom. Those who do live elsewhere often serve as representatives and ambassadors, a popular role due to their demeanor.</p>
			<p>Within the Chess Kingdom, Afilides work as guardians and provide much of the kingdom's labor force. They drive trains, work in construction, plan reforms, and perform various regular jobs.</p>
			<p>All Afilides share the same voice box configuration, giving them identical voices under normal circumstances. Some use this feature to create unique chorus and music styles. Others, seeking individuality, undergo a process to change their voices, though this is generally frowned upon by most other Afilides.</p>
