            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Red Corals are Natura Oceans Corralis, commonly found spread across the seabed of the Mareala Sea, often in regions where Blue Corals also inhabit.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Red Corals boast a reddish hue, featuring a smooth texture adorned with multiple upward-reaching branches. Sporting two black eyes with white pupils, and a mouth filled with sharp teeth.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Red Corals are a conglomerate of numerous microorganisms with an intricate hive mind that operates as a unified entity.</p>
			<p>Their growth pattern involves branching upwards, attracting unsuspecting marine fauna that mistake them for Blue Corals. When the prey draw near, the Red Corals consume them, this tactic is particularly effective on species unable to discern colors.</p>
			<p>Unlike the Blue Corals, Red Corals can move completely at their liking, They usually crawl to populated areas to feed on them.</p>
			<p>In contrast to Blue Corals, Red Corals possess full mobility. They often move toward populated areas to feed on marine life. Their diet primarily comprises meat, enabling their proliferation and eventual acquisition of mobility and animalistic intelligence, thanks to the rich nutritional content of Mareala's creatures.</p>
			<p>Distinct from Blue Corals, Red Corals have functional, fully mobile eyes, an evolutionary feature that took considerable time to develop due to their genetic challenges.</p>
			<p>Red Corals outgrow, overpower, and feed on Blue Corals, marking them their 'rival' species.</p>
			<p>When Red Corals reach a particular size, they undergo division, generating an offspring that is a complete replica of the original.</p>
			<p>The microorganisms within a Red Coral specialize in various tasks like mobility, vision, and other internal functions. If one is removed or damaged, other microorganisms can adapt to assume the role of the impaired part. There exist specific "templates" that these microorganisms utilize to transform into the required organ or segment. However, if these templates are damaged or mutated, all the microorganisms will inherit this mutation, which persists and affects their future generations.</p>
			<p>Creating new templates for adaptation to the environment is particularly challenging for Red Corals. These genetic hurdles have troubled Red Corals for centuries, nearly leading them to extinction multiple times.</p>
			<p>Their intricate organism continues to confound scientists, their capabilities and evolution remaining a subject of fascination and study.</p>
