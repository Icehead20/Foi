            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Colosers are Natura Earthrast Ondulars, an ancient species of gigantic creatures that once lived in the northern region of the Prime Continent. In modern times, only one individual of this species remains.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are enormous, limbless creatures with elongated bodies. Their bottom half is blue, while their top half is white with gray spikes along their back. They have large yellow eyes and four 'flesh' teeth in their big mouths.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Colosers, like most ancient creatures of the Magma Age, were nearly wiped out during the event known as The Coma. However, one survived and is currently owned by Olbways, the Queen of The Politemia. Some Colosers managed to escape to Coconut Island, where they eventually evolved into other species.</p>
			<p>The modern member of the Ondulars classification that most closely resembles the Coloser genetically is the SerSerSer. It is believed that all Ondulars descended from those that survived The Coma on Coconut Island.</p>
			<p>Colosers are naturally long-lived creatures, but with proper care and protection, they can extend their lifespans indefinitely. In the wild, they rarely lived to old age due to sickness, starvation, and battles with other species.</p>
			<p>They spend most of their time underground, but when they sleep, they raise their heads and top halves above ground to breathe better while resting their muscles. They will wake if they sense any nearby danger.</p>
			<p>When they perceive danger, they lift their heads to locate and intimidate the threat. If it is a real threat, they will tackle it head-on, attempting to bite and wrap it with their bodies while releasing a howl to call for help from other Colosers.</p>
			<p>Colosers travel in herds and usually stick together. When sleeping, they form a spiral with their young at the center for protection. They are very communal and protective of their offspring, even risking their lives to defend them.</p>
			<p>They have the strength to easily destroy trees and rocks and are adept at digging and excavating underground. When close to prey, they surface to launch a surprise attack. Colosers prefer not to be seen eating, so they drag their prey underground to consume it. Though they are omnivorous, they primarily eat meat.</p>
			<p>In ancient times, they were one of the few creatures capable of defeating Kingstains. However, they were more vulnerable to Filestes than most other ancient creatures due to their large size, which provided more areas for the Filestes to attack. They were especially vulnerable while sleeping, as Filestes could quietly approach and attack them.</p>
			<p>If treated properly, Colosers can become very docile, as demonstrated by the one in Olbways' care. It takes a long time to gain their trust, but once achieved, they care for their master as if they were one of their offspring.</p>
