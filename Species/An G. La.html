            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>An G. La are Natura Ocean Finers that primarily inhabit the large rivers and near coasts areas of the warm regions of both continents, usually living near bottom and inside underwater caves.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>An G. La are elongated, limbless green creatures with a distinct yellow underbelly. Their bodies are sleek, with a small snout lined with sharp teeth and small, black eyes. One of their most recognizable features is a gelatinous pink crest that runs vertically along their body, starting from the back of their head and continuing to the bottom of their jaw.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>An G. La were once considered mythical beings, part of the Forestala region's “An” myths—folklore about marine monsters of diverse appearance but all sharing the characteristics of elongation and limblessness. But their existence was confirmed by the investigator Gideon Lambert, who gave them the name “The An of Gideon Lambert” in reference to himself, but later was shortened to An G. La, their most common name.</p>
			<p>An G. La are herbivores that specialize in consuming the toughest underwater plants. They use their sharp teeth to rip and chop the stems and roots of aquatic flora, often digging slightly with their snouts to access buried roots. It’s been noticed that populations living in areas with softer vegetation, often those that live in large rivers, tend to develop flatter, less sharp teeth.</p>
			<p>An G. La dwell in small caves or holes at the bottom of their aquatic habitats, being able to coil and compress their gelatinous body to fit inside really small orifices, with each individual occupying its own individual space. Despite this unitary housing arrangement, they form tightly-knit communities by living in close proximity to one another. Often sharing food and using body movements to communicate the locations of resources. They especially seem to care for sick or pregnant members, helping them the most.</p>
			<p>When pregnant, An G. La remain in their holes until giving birth, often producing only one offspring. Afterward, the mother relocates to a new hole, leaving the original space to her offspring. She continues to provide food by storing portions in her mouth and traveling back to her previous hole to feed the young, regardless of the distance.</p>
			<p>The slimy coating on their bodies makes An G. La exceptionally difficult to grip, allowing them to evade many predators, being one of the few species that are consistently able to escape Fategas’ grip. However, they are still vulnerable to direct bites from larger predators. One of their most significant threats is the Garden Agala, which often surprises them when they search for a hole to inhabit. Although they have sharp teeth, they rarely use them to defend themselves.</p>
			<p>The gelatinous crest that runs vertically throughout their body is highly nutritious, which has led to predators especially targeting them when they’re ill or injured. This crest also possess insulating properties that protect them against electrical discharges like those produced by Thunderhuds, although this 2 species barely met so this ability is rarely used and is thought to be an non intended feature rather than an evolutionary adaptation.</p>
			<p>An G. La have become a significant resource in the Carala and Forestala regions. In which they are fished for the nutritional value of their crest which is served in various ways as an alternative healthier option and for specific medicinal applications and uses.</p>
			<p>“Gripping An G. La Tournaments” are a tradition held in Coconut Island at the start of summer, An G. La are stored on buckets of water and the contestant must try to hold them with their feet and legs outside water for the longest amount of time possible to win the competition.</p>
			<p>Their slime has been marketed in a wide range of products claiming various health benefits, though none of these effects have been proven, leading many to dismiss such products as scams.</p>
