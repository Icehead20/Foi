            <p>Cristalife are Civil Artificial Crystalogy created and primarily residing in Plus Mountain. They are the most basic form of Crystalogy robot design and served as the foundation for all later Crystalogy models.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Cristalife are simple creatures composed of a Purple Crystal that serves as their body, usually a three-point crystal with a hexagonal base. They have four thin black robotic legs, and on one of their fronts, they have two black eyes.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Cristalife are created using Plus Mountain's Purple Crystals as their main power source, incorporating mechanical robotic parts to harness and shape this energy into a form of life. Their Purple Crystals are stored completely externally, while their energy conversion mechanisms are housed within their robotic eyes.</p>
			<p>The Purple Crystals serve not only as an energy source but also as storage for their memories and personalities. Damage to these crystals can lead to mental issues and other complications.</p>
			<p>After the discovery of the Purple Crystals’ energy and properties, various proto-Cristalife experiments known as “Cristalgems” were conducted. The refined and finalized product of these experiments is the Cristalife we have today, which became the first mass-produced Crystalogy model.</p>
			<p>Cristalife is one of the Crystalogy models with the highest production and population. Despite its simple design, which was improved upon in later Crystalogy models, Cristalife remains prevalent. Most Cristalife reside on Plus Mountain, but they are not uncommon in other regions. As the first Crystalogy, they often represent the entire line and work to represent Plus Mountain and their robotic lineage in external politics.</p>
			<p>Their legs are designed to be sharp, allowing them to cling to and walk on walls, which is suitable for the rugged terrain of Plus Mountain. These legs are a modified version of the legs used by the Eslabian robot model, Afilides.</p>
			<p>Since their Purple Crystals are completely exposed, Cristalife move carefully and slowly, staying aware of their environment and avoiding hazards. This cautious nature often leads them to be found in unusual places and positions.</p>
			<p>When they were first designed, facial expressions were not considered, so their eyes are nearly fixed and barely able to move or express emotions, making their thoughts difficult to decipher.</p>
			<p>Without a specific job in mind at their creation, Cristalife enjoys a high degree of freedom and autonomy, even more so than many biological beings. They are introspective and often interested in arts and philosophy.</p>
			<p>On Plus Mountain, they are considered one of the primary populations alongside Mitops. They engage in various jobs, contributing to the kingdom's functioning and development. Cristalife residing outside of Plus Mountain, aside from those serving as representatives, usually focus on developing their artistic talents or personal growth.</p>
