            <p>Mitops are Civil Natura Malormers Undercavers native to Plus Mountain. They are considered the 'children' of Diamonch, who nurtured and guided their evolution over hundreds of years from their ancient form to their current one.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Mitops are bipedal creatures, taller than most quadruped Civil species but shorter than most bipedal Civil species. They have yellow fur, red noses with black whiskers, white claws on their paws, and black tentacles on their rear.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Diamonch originally discovered a species called Therciary living on the outskirts of Plus Mountain. Inspired by the evolution of Slardiens, Diamonch cared for the Therciary, eventually guiding their evolution into the intelligent species known today as Mitops.</p>
			<p>Mitops live almost exclusively in Plus Mountain, primarily working for Diamonch in various mining roles. Otherwise, they are involved in the arts, which are popular among Mitops but more niche among other species. Outside of Plus Mountain, Mitops often work in the creation of underground facilities and tunnels.</p>
			<p>Mitops are one of the few species with a nose, which they originally used to smell prey for hunting. In modern times, smells have become culturally significant for Mitops. They have developed a language based on smells, enhancing their art and entertainment with a unique depth. They have even created entire products centered around scents, such as "Smell Operas.".</p>
			<p>In Mitops culture, it is considered improper to show their bottom half under any circumstances. They typically travel via tunnels they dig, only exposing their top half when necessary on the surface. This practice has led to conspiracy theories about what their bottom halves look like, but these accusations have always been denied.</p>
			<p>Mitops lack taste buds and are not picky eaters, resulting in Plus Mountain’s cuisine being considered unpalatable, focusing on nutritional value over taste.</p>
			<p>They can excavate using their claws, but they also have a method of digging by ingesting dirt, which is then expelled through the other side with the help of their tentacles. This method, however, does not leave a hole and is less effective than how it was when they were Therciary, and is mostly abandoned in recent times.</p>
			<p>Mitops are not accustomed to physical affection and usually feel uncomfortable with it. They express affection through gestures like bowing or closing their eyes, which signify trust in their culture.</p>
			<p>Mitops have the ability to reorganize their organs within their bodies, moving them closer to the center or more externally depending on the excavation situation. This adaptation helps keep their organs safe during different types of digging activities.</p>
			<p>When Mitops reproduce, they interconnect their tentacles while both are underground, facing different directions. It is considered improper in their culture for them to see or touch each other with anything other than their tentacles during this process.</p>
			<p>Diamonch’s employment of both Mitops and Crystal Robots has raised questions about free will and slavery in some circles, with some believing Diamonch forces them to work. Diamonch has stated this is untrue, asserting that he cares for and loves all his creations and "children," allowing them to pursue anything they desire.</p>
