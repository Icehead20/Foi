            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Earthworms are Natura Earthrast Ondulars that inhabit the underground regions of both the Verdosola and Acela regions.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Earthworms are small, pink, rope-shaped creatures characterized by a single small mouth and two large venomous glands resembling eyes.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>They navigate by burrowing through the soil, creating extensive and lengthy tunnels beneath the earth's surface, which serve as their habitats.</p>
			<p>Earthworms consume various organic matter they encounter, including decaying plant material, they also enjoy chewing on the roots of plants. They locate their food by following scents and sensing the texture of the soil around them.</p>
			<p>Their skin has the ability to absorb moisture from their environment, and in return, it secretes a thin layer of mucus. This mucus aids in their movement through the underground tunnels they inhabit.</p>
			<p>Their two eye-shaped glands produce poison, which serves as their defense mechanism. These glands are strategically shaped to break easily when the earthworm is attacked by a predator. As a result, the poison spills onto the predator, causing harm and deterring further attacks.</p>
			<p>The poison is characterized by its viscous, green consistency and acts similarly to a low-potency acid. Upon contact with the skin, it causes irritation and pain in the victim. However, its effects are particularly potent against Birds, potentially leading to more severe harm and even death.</p>
			<p>The unique shape and location of the Earthworm's glands are an evolutionary response to the predatory behavior of the Turnkeye. These predators typically target the eyes of their prey to impair their visibility. Consequently, the Earthworm's glands have evolved to mimic eyes, positioned in a way that leads the Turnkeye to mistake them for actual eyes. As a result, when the Turnkeye attacks, it inadvertently triggers the release of poison, causing harm to itself.</p>
			<p>Earthworms have a short lifespan, typically living only a few weeks. When it comes time to reproduce, they typically give birth to between 10 to 35 offspring. Earthworms reproduce asexually once they reach maturity. Segments of their tail end naturally detach and with time will grow into new Earthworms.</p>
			<p>The venomous glands of Earthworms deflate when they are underground to facilitate digging, allowing them to move through the soil more efficiently. If needed, they can even expel the acid produced by these glands, sweating it out to become more slick. Earthworms are immune to their own poison.</p>
			<p>Once a poisonous gland breaks, it does not regenerate. Any damaged parts will naturally fall off, and the wound will close up. However, the lifespan of the Earthworm may be affected by such injuries.</p>
			<p>Earthworms are raised in farms where their poison glands are removed to make them suitable for the consumption of Lagainzas. Earthworms are also utilized as a means to clear flora and kill small plants by feeding on their roots, thereby preventing their growth.</p>
