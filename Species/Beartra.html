            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Beartra is Civil Divine Ghosts, that primarily inhabit the south end of the Prime Continent.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Beartra take the form of small, round creatures crafted from a solid, bone-like material, distinct from the ethereal substance that comprises other Ghosts. Their bodies feature big, black eyes, and perched atop their heads are two large, spiky halves resembling a large spike trap.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>When a soul, with a morality predominantly leaning towards goodness, finds its remains in the Blue Plane will be reborn as a Beartra. They may or may not retain memories of their past life depending on how succesful they were in this process before being attacked and consumed by the Hellsnake.</p>
			<p>They possess a peculiar habit of sleeping wherever they are, causing their spikes to relax and open. If touched during this state, their will spikes automatically and abruptly close, the Beartra cannot control this reflex.</p>
			<p>Despite their intimidating appearance, Beartra are generally kind-hearted creatures. Their eyes, which appear constantly angry, remain in a perpetually half-open state due to their size being too large for their heads.</p>
			<p>Beartras use their spikes like arms, albeit stiffer and less mobile than actual arms.</p>
			<p>Due to their small size and limited range of movement, Beartras often face challenges when adapting to environments not designed for them. It's common for them to craft custom solutions, including tailored houses and products, to accommodate their unique needs.</p>
			<p>Beartras, along with Garangoas, exhibit a remarkable spectrum of morality among Ghosts. This diversity has led to uncertainty among other species about what their capable of. Despite Beartras asserting that their differences are not as pronounced as perceived compared to non-Ghosts species.</p>
			<p>Having nearly perfect vision, Beartra often serve as vigilant guardians and security personnel in institutions and on the frontiers of kingdoms.</p>
			<p>While Beartras can endure cracks and breakages, they remain functional as long as their eyes are intact. Destruction of both eyes results in permanent demise for the Beartra.</p>
			<p>Their innate tendency to seamlessly integrate into groups makes them appear as if they have always been part of the collective, a fact seemingly unnoticed by the Beartra themselves.</p>
			<p>The initial encounters between Beartras and other species were marked by their ability to blend into groups without detection. This often startled other species when they eventually became aware of the Beartra's presence. However, through open dialogue and communication, Beartras have successfully integrated into society, although lingering prejudices still persist among certain individuals.</p>
			<p>Similar to other Ghosts, Beartras are susceptible to Soulnaker energy, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than some of their spectral counterparts.</p>
