            <p>Bodys are a Civil Natura CosiPlant F/A species native to the jungles of the Ebri Kingdom and its surrounding regions, where they remain a dominant population.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Bodys are spherical green creatures with sharp mouths and a long, thorny vine sprouting from a yellow crest atop their heads. The crest features three stems, distinguishing them from other CosiPlant species, which typically display two pink stems. There are two known Body variants: One possesses a large pink flower with long petals extending beneath the crest and bright red eyes. The other has a smaller, bushier flower and black eyes.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Although the existence of the both variants and its traits resemble sexual dimorphism, both variants can be of any gender. Red-eyed individuals are more common among females, while black-eyed ones are more common among males. The origin of this variation is uncertain, though it is believed to relate to ancestral differences in sunlight exposure.</p>
			<p>The crest of Bodys resembles those of other CosiPlant species, especially those native to the Zet Continent, though its unique yellow coloration and three-stemmed structure suggest early divergence. Genetically, Bodys are most closely related to Doblead and Envivors, sharing similarities in mouth shape and coloration.</p>
			<p>Their most distinctive feature is the thorny vine extending from the crest. This appendage functions as a powerful, highly mobile limb capable of grappling, swinging, clinging, and striking. The thorns allow secure gripping of surfaces, and under the right conditions, Bodys can achieve remarkable speed and agility while swinging. If damaged, the vine regenerates, though the new growth tends to have misshapen thorns and a more pale color. Because Bodys rely on a single vine, tools and items designed for them often account for this limitation.</p>
			<p>On the ground, Bodys move by hopping, but in the treetops they use their vine for swift, acrobatic movement. Their external bodies are soft and fluffy, cushioning them from heavy impacts, while their internal plant organs—including their teeth—are specially adapted to resist force and damage.</p>
			<p>Bodys rely partly on sunlight, but the energy they absorb sustains only their vine, requiring them to consume external food to support the rest of their body. They also absorb water in multiple ways: directly through their skin, orally, or via their vine, which can rapidly hydrate the entire body.</p>
			<p>Bodys reproduce by intertwining their stems with a partner, producing a large seed from the tip of the vine. The seed germinates over 5–7 months, sprouting the vine first, then the crest. Once the crest emerges, the parents pull the vine to extract the rest of the offspring, revealing a Body sprout that grows gradually to full size.</p>
			<p>Before becoming a Civil species, Bodys lived as wild hunters. They used their vines to swing among treetops, launching themselves downward to bite prey with great force. They often rested hanging from branches, feeding on Mutibugs while waiting for larger prey to pass below.</p>
			<p>Their path to civilization began with small wooden hideouts in the treetops, which developed into homes and storage structures. With reliable food supplies, their intelligence advanced, giving rise to a structured culture.</p>
			<p>When the First Kings arrived with the Mind Queen, Bodys merged their traditions with those of the Minds and later with the Souls, forming the foundation of the Ebri Kingdom. Today, Bodys make up much of the Kingdom’s population.</p>
			<p>Bodys traditionally sleep while hanging, clinging to objects and locking in with their vine’s thorns. However, this often damages the object used for rest. As a result, a competitive market now exists for durable “climbing poles” designed to withstand repeated use.</p>
