            <p>Peons are Artificial Eslabians designed to function as the primary soldiers of the Chess Kingdom, which also serves as the primary habitat for the majority of the species population.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Peons are medium-sized creatures characterized by a round spiked-ball body with two red ovals below it, which serve as their feet. They are simple in design without many complexities.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>To attack, Peons employ a straightforward strategy: they charge at the enemy in large groups, rolling and running to create an avalanche of spikes aimed at impaling the target. Often, the mere threat of this formidable assault is sufficient to compel most enemies to surrender.</p>
			<p>For larger enemies, once they have pierced the target, they spin like drills to perforate the enemy's skin, creating a hole through which other Peons can enter. Once inside, they continue to spin, grinding the enemy from the inside out.</p>
			<p>Peons are designed primarily for killing when they're deploy. Afilides and Toweniors are responsible for operations involving immobilization, where it is preferable not to kill the target, along with other typically non-lethal operations.</p>
			<p>In the hierarchy of the Chess Kingdom, all other primary members hold higher ranks than the Peons, so they are all in charge and capable of commanding them.</p>
			<p>Peons will often trip and walk clumsily due to the inconsistent and variable placement of their spikes. Therefore, when they aren't on a mission, they tend to walk slowly. In battles against the enemy, since they're in such large quantities and the objective is to create an avalanche of spikes, this isn't as much of a problem. However, in everyday life, other people naturally tend to leave some distance between themselves and Peons.</p>
			<p>No matter how much they are hit, Peons can't feel any physical pain. They are virtually indestructible to physical hits, as only a very strong force is able to crack them. However, like other robots, one of their only weaknesses is melting.</p>
			<p>For all these reasons, Peons are considered the perfect soldiers. Other kingdoms would have used them too if the Chess Kingdom hadn't allowed it and expressed its desire for these models not to be produced by other nations. Therefore, they can only be borrowed for really dangerous missions in desperate situations.</p>
			<p>Peons primarily inhabit The Chess Kingdom, with instances found elsewhere being those borrowed for special missions. Following missions outside the kingdom, an extensive count of Peons is conducted within the Chess Kingdom to prevent kidnapping or other potential issues.</p>
			<p>When not fighting, Peons rest by wandering around the kingdom without specific tasks, at most they surveillance the streets. They have one of the lower sentience levels among all the robots, barely even being categorized as 'Civil' by experts. They gain this classification due to their capacity to express feelings, even though these aren't as pronounced as those of other robots.</p>
			<p>When a Peon witnesses a crime, it will intervene by confronting the criminals. However, lethal force is not applied unless ordered by higher authorities. The Peon will attempt to deter the criminals by threatening them with their spikes and may target the criminals' feet to immobilize them without causing that much harm.</p>
			<p>Peons are mute and can only communicate with others via body language, physical movements, and simple expressions.</p>
			<p>Interpersonal relationships among Peons are peculiar and subject to change without a clear pattern. Despite differences in attitudes and physical movements, individuals in these relationships seem to understand each other, fostering a unique form of communication and connection exclusive to each individual relationship.</p>
			<p>Peons in the Chess Kingdom reside in specialized towers designed to accommodate a large number of them in compact spaces. When in these towers, Peons can nearly shut down all functions and rest for undetermined periods of time.</p>
