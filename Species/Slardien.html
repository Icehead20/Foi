            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Slardiens are Civil Natura Malormes Exoceanic known for their distinct appearance and origin under the care of Parac.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>Slardiens lack arms, hands, or legs. Instead, they possess large dark green feet and while lighter green fur covering the rest of their body which grows longer in some areas of the head. Their defining feature is a large bone emerging from their backs.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>They were first discovered as animal species originally called Fishyan by Parac, one of the kings of the First Kingdom, in Still River. With Parac's nurturing, protection, and education, they evolved years later into the intelligent sapience Slardiens of today.</p>
			<p>The bone they possess was once cartilage but has developed into a larger, thicker, and heavier structure over generations, but the weight of it cause Slardiens to adquire a hunched position.</p>
			<p>Since the conception of the Slardiens as an intelligent species, they have served the royal family as their army using their bone as a weapon.</p>
			<p>Slardiens exhibit an astonishingly rapid evolutionary capacity. However, this swift evolution has resulted in imprecise adaptations, limiting their utility in expected functionalities.</p>
			<p>The female Slardiens lack several traits present in males. Their bone is too diminutive to serve in combat, but this also mean they are spare from the weight and posture issues experienced by males, often resulting in females being taller than the males.</p>
			<p>Slardiens aspiring to join the Royal First Army undergo a process where their bone is trimmed and shaped into a sword. They receive training in swordsmanship and other essential skills, becoming soldiers known as 'Espadan' within the army.</p>
			<p>Due to their incapability to engage in combat with their bone, female Slardiens assume the role of informants. They gather and analyze information, reporting to the kings and vigilantly warning others of imminent dangers in a polite yet noisy manner. This has made them evolved adquiring heightened senses of vision, hearing, and alertness compared to males, but with the downside of them often getting nervous.</p>
			<p>In recent times, Slardien females have been part of an experiment aimed at enabling their participation in military roles. A weapon, named the '4DF2B Useful', has been devisedâ€”a cannon directly connected to the carrier's back nerves, rendering it irremovable once attached.</p>
			<p>The cannon experiment proved successful, granting females interested in military service the opportunity to join. However, the weight of the cannon causes them similar back problems as males. These females wielding the cannon are referred to as 'Salts'.</p>
			<p>The sheer superiority of the 4DF2B Useful cannon over conventional Espadan swords has raised doubts about the traditional army's value compared to the might of the cannons. There have been discussions about transitioning the entire army to this technology, providing cannons to males as well. However, Parac, who holds complete authority over the army, staunchly opposes this change.</p>
			<p>Due to their lack of arms, Slardiens face limitations in the type of work they can undertake. It's widely accepted within their society that most Slardiens will enlist in the army due to this limitation.</p>
			<p>The majority of Slardien reside in The First Kingdom, where they constitute the primary workforce. Over time, the kings have tailored the kingdom to accommodate the specific needs of the Slardien population.</p>
			<p>Throughout their history, the Slardien species has not experienced any significant uprisings. Parac, having nurtured and guided them with meticulous attention, ensured the species' comfort and contentment with their circumstances.</p>
			<p>Due to their association with the First Kings, Slardiens are often perceived as imposing or possessing inherent authority by other species. This perception has occasionally led to social unease and discomfort among other species.</p>
			<p>The male Slardiens possess a naturally serious disposition. Once they commit to a goal, they persistently pursue it, showcasing immense loyalty and dedication to their tasks.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, female Slardiens are often deemed paragons of personality by both their own species and others. They are recognized for their loyalty and education, although they may have a higher tendency to relinquish pursuits compared to their male counterparts.</p>
			<p>The anticipated ideal of perfection for female Slardiens has led to self-esteem issues for some individuals, as they struggle to meet these elevated standards. This challenge has resulted in various problems surfacing in recent years within the community.</p>
			<p>The Slardien army is categorized into three distinct divisions: The Sponge division focuses on safeguarding the kingdom against external threats and handling major issues. The Filled division is responsible for ensuring the kingdom's security, serving as guards and addressing certain internal matters. Lastly, the Coral division, the largest unit, is primarily involved in policing activities. They patrol extensively, addressing issues across the continent from strategically placed checkpoints. Additionally, they verify the status of other kingdoms and nations, extending assistance in resolving any challenges they may encounter.</p>
