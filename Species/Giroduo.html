            <p>Giroduos are Civil Artificial Eslabians designed to be guardian robots tasked with protecting the First Kingdom, especially safeguarding top-secret governmental installations and objects.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are large, flat, gray, and possess a slightly moldable metal square structure. A rectangular hole on one side serves as their face, from which their jaws emerge. On the opposite side, they are adorned with small holes used for emitting fire. Internally, they house intricate mechanisms.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>They were initially created in Eslawba as an experiment to test the capabilities of the Eslawba's robot factory.</p>
			<p>They harness the power of Gravitry stones within them, enabling them to move freely and float through the air as well as 'hold' objects close to them.</p>
			<p>Known for their unwavering loyalty, Giroduos employ an offensive strategy of 'Controlled Chaos,' executing seemingly random yet highly calculated attacks against their enemies.</p>
			<p>Over the years, Giroduo technology has seen improvements (althought their external desing have been keep the same), with those equipped with inferior technology often retiring.</p>
			<p>Primarily employed to safeguard government secrets, they became a replacement for War Hammers after The Wars War and have continued this role since.</p>
			<p>Equipped with a flamethrower, Giroduos utilize it for both defense and offense. The flamethrower can be toggled on or off, and its intensity can be adjusted at will.</p>
			<p>Giroduos can also use their jaws to attack enemies, as they are sharp enough to cut through skin. However, it is expected for them to rely on their flamethrowers to flawlessly defeat their enemies. Giroduos who have to resort to using their jaws in a situation are often looked down upon and shamed by other Giroduos.</p>
			<p>Giroduos rely on infrared vision emitted from the same opening as their jaws, because of the use of this technology for vision they lack the ability to perceive colors.</p>
			<p>Their bodies possess slight elasticity and generate high temperatures, an internal mechanism regulates their heat to prevent overheating.</p>
			<p>Giroduos aren't very sociable with other Giroduos, but they can be more sociable with other species. However, they usually hold themselves in high regard, which has been perceived as repellent by some people.</p>
			<p>The outdated and suboptimal design of Giroduos has faced scrutiny multiple times, with recommendations for a significant redesign, but the First Kingdom has consistently rejected the idea.</p>
			<p>Retired Giroduos often find employment in fire-related occupations.</p>
