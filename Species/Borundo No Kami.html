            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Borundo No Kami are Civil Divine Wormterrein native of Ejpon and Terraido in Desautala, their original place of creation.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>They are semi-circular clay figures with two partially open black eyes. Their defining feature lies on their backsâ€”a blue loop from which a large blonde ponytail, also crafted from clay, extends.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Distinct from other hand-made Wormterrains of Desautala (such as Shokeimoji-Me and Shokeimoji-Paharo), Borundo No Kamis differ in their overall shape, colors, and capabilities.</p>
			<p>They're crafted in molds where specific portions of Gravitry are strategically positioned at the core to grant them gravity manipulation abilities. Subsequently, a blend of clay and Wormterrain liquid fills the mold. Once solidified, the Wormterrain assimilates the structure, birthing a new Borundo No Kami.</p>
			<p>Unlike the others, their gravity manipulation doesn't make them float. Instead, it enhances mobility in their ponytails, allowing a more natural movement that they can control almost like a limb.</p>
			<p>Created by Queenork with assistance from the inhabitants of the old Terraido kingdom, Borundo No Kamis were initially employed in delivery services, as thinkers, and as repositories of memory.</p>
			<p>The most esteemed among them served as guardians in the queen's chambers.</p>
			<p>Once considered paragons of beauty among other Wormterrains, marrying one was seen as a significant status elevation.</p>
			<p>While easily provoked, Borundo No Kamis are not inherently violent but can be brusque. A calm Borundo No Kami that trusts someone can be remarkably gentle and even affectionate.</p>
			<p>Since the cessation of hand-made Wormterrain production in Terraido, they have become increasingly scarce. Most reside in the kingdoms of Desautala, with only a few scattered across other regions.</p>
			<p>The decline of the Terraido Kingdom has led to hardships for the Borundo No Kami, resulting in a widespread sense of purposelessness among the population in recent years.</p>
