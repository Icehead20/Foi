            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>War-Earthworms are Natura Wars Animawar that predominantly dwell underground on the Moon named War, primarily inhabiting the valleys and forests within its subterranean realm.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <div class="section-title">Appearance</div>
            <p>War-Earthworms are characterized by their small purple segmented tube-shaped bodies, adorned with a line of thorns along their backs and heads. They possess prominent jaws, along with two yellow eyes and the distinctively long ears with black tips that are characteristic of creatures native to the Moon War.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Description</div>
            <p>Their bodies are robust and formidable, capable of burrowing through even the toughest rocks. However, they are significantly weaker in wet and humid environments, struggling to move effectively in non-dry conditions.</p>
			<p>They are highly vulnerable to low temperatures, constantly in motion to retain heat and prevent cooling, as extreme cold can lead to internal organ failure.</p>
			<p>They construct their dwellings by digging shallow burrows in dry land, often beneath rocks, although they tend to spend the majority of their time on the surface.</p>
			<p>On the surface, they crawl and use their sensitive ears to locate potential prey, typically scavenging corpses or even preying on other members of their species. When two War-Earthworms encounter each other, they engage in combat, often culminating in one devouring the other.</p>
			<p>When they locate food, War-Earthworms consume it entirely, leaving only the bones behind. They retain much of the fat and energy from their meals in their tube-shaped stomachs, processing it slowly to sustain themselves over extended periods.</p>
			<p>War-Earthworms reproduce asexually by expelling eggs from their mouths and burying them underground. These eggs absorb space radiation through the earth, using it both for development and as a heat source. Upon hatching, they are already fully developed.</p>
			<p>War-Earthworms are solitary creatures, rarely seen together without engaging in combat or interacting with other species. When they lay eggs, they scatter them far apart from each other and abandon them after release.</p>
			<p>The War-Earthworms occupy the lowest tier of the War's food chain, with many other War species relying on them for sustenance. Their disappearance could potentially disrupt the entire ecosystem, causing significant repercussions for other species in the War moon.</p>
